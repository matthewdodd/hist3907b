# Matthew Dodd: What the Government wants you to know
*Checkpoint 1: Initial thoughts & data*
--------

*Primary Data*: https://twitter.com/gccaedits ; With over 1,800 tweets regarding the edits to Wikipedia from "Canadian Government IP addresses" this information, when gathered into a massive .json file can provide a variety of information about what the government and its employees are editing and changing on Wikipedia.

*Collection method*: I intend to use TWARC (still need to get fully setup) on a Linux (Ubuntu) machine to grab the data (in a .json or .geojson format). 

*Repository structure*: https://github.com/matthewdodd/hist3907b/tree/master/gccaedits ; This folder will contain: a subfolder with all of the raw data grabbed using TWARC, another subfolder with the cleaned data, and a third subfolder with the actual analysis and visualizations. In the root of the folder will be the primary writings about the subfolders.

*Secondary Readings*: https://github.com/matthewdodd/hist3907b/tree/master/gccaedits/notes

*Initial thoughts on what you might find/explore/puzzle over:*
- In this section, a paragraph or two might be appropriate. 
- Reflect on the Posner video you watched as well.
- What kinds of exploratory visualizations/analyses might be useful for you to try?
- Where do you think this project might go?
