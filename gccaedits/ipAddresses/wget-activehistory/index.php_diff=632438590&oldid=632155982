At its inception, [[Upper Canada]] was only sparsely settled (unlike the more established [[Lower Canada]]) and its land had not been officially surveyed to any great extent. Thus, there was an urgency by the then [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] to survey this new and relatively barren province for establishing military roads and for preventing settlers from clearing and settling land not legally belonging to them. Predating [[Upper Canada]], however, the earliest European settlers to arrive and clear land in the mid-18th century in what would eventually become Ancaster were mostly a wilderness society made up of American farmers travelling north searching for arable land &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/upper-canada/#top&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent [[French language in Canada|French speaking]] [[North American Fur Trade|fur traders]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] immigrants travelling southward. Also arriving into this area again travelling north in substantial numbers around 1787 with the incentive of inexpensive land grants were the [[United Empire Loyalists]] still loyal to the British crown who were fleeing from the [[United States]] after the 1776 [[American War of Independence]]. Britain's promise of free land brought many people from the new republic to the south and east, who did not exhibit the same loyalty to the crown as the Loyalists. This would eventually lead to series of defections, accusations and treasonous acts  during the War of 1812 that precipitated the largest mass hangings in Canadian history, the so-called [[Bloody Assizes]] whose trial took place in Ancaster in 1814. When Upper Canada was invaded by the United States during the [[War of 1812]] its occupants were primarily of American ancestry.  However, after the war the province would have a noticeably more British centered influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/upper-canada/&lt;/ref&gt; Britain expected its colonies to purchase all essential finished goods needed for day-to-day living from the mother country in exchange for raw materials such as fur and lumber. However, this 'arrangement' naturally proved to be very inefficient and impractical in practice so waterwheels, mills and factories soon hurriedly evolved in favourable towns in Upper Canada  that had abundant water power, fertile soil, and good transportation access such as Ancaster that could then provide the new settlers with a good measure of self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Canadian People, WM.

They scattered far and wide; they would seem to have selected their lands rather like rummagers at a bargain sale, by feel or look.

  <td class="diff-deletedline"><div>In an age before steam power, the wilderness that would become Ancaster had an early economic advantage due to the fact that it existed<del class="diffchange diffchange-inline"> naturally</del> amidst a break in the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. Thus even its relatively minor water resources were valuable because they were easily accessible. Just as vital an influence in Ancaster's rapid development was the fact that it already had access to two very important prehistoric [[First Nations]] roads<del class="diffchange diffchange-inline">. In other words the successful settlement that would become Ancaster wasn't entirely by chance</del>. The first European settlers to set foot in this region would have encountered the Iroquois Trail and the [[Mohawk Road (Hamilton, Ontario)|Mohawk Trail]] intersecting precisely in the area that would eventually become Ancaster Village. This aboriginal Iroquois trail had become the most important transportation route in Upper Canada. It meandered down the escarpment from the future Ancaster into what would eventually become Hamilton, Ontario towards present day [[Lewiston, New York]], eventually linking up with similar aboriginal trails in [[New York]]. In the other direction the Iroquois trail led from present day Ancaster to what would eventually become the town of [[Brantford|Brantford, Ontario]] whereupon the trail then branched off into the Detroit Path and the Long Point trail. By 1770, the 80 kilometre Mohawk Trail was essentially the escarpment accompaniment of the lakeside Iroquois trail. The Mohawk Trail ran parallel to the Iroquois trail and originated and diverged from the Iroquois trail in present day [[Queenston, Ontario]] until finally ending and reconnecting to the Iroquois Trail in present day Ancaster at what is now known as the intersection of Rousseaux and Wilson Street. The two trails actually interconnected in four locations along the Mohawk Trail's 80 kilometre route when favourable escarpment conditions permitted. By 1785, the Iroquois Trail passing through present day Ancaster had been widened to accommodate horse and buggy traffic. Another influential road that intersected the Mohawk Trail very close to Ancaster Village was the Twenty Mile road that followed the [[Twenty Mile Creek]] up to present day [[Smithville, Ontario]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="The Niagara Peninsula 1851"&gt;The Origin And Development Of The Road Network Of The Niagara Peninsula, Ontario, 1770-1851.

  <td class="diff-context"><div>Ancaster was established formally in 1792, but the area now referred to as Ancaster Village had been referred to informally by local villagers by the more colourful name of Wilson's Mills. This was in reference to millwright James Wilson who along with his affluent fur trader, entrepreneur and business partner [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]] were the primary founders of Ancaster village. With Beasley’s financial backing, Wilson built a gristmill in 1791 and a sawmill in 1792 that would be the only mills west of Grimsby for many years. In order to attract workers to his mills, Wilson needed to provide the social amenities and commercial framework for an area of land which in that period was an isolated frontier forest with accessible water power situated precisely at the juncture of already well-established pre-historical indigenous transportation trails. In that period the area was populated with just a smattering of [[First Nations]] aboriginal peoples and wilderness farmers. Again, with Beasley's financial assistance, Wilson managed to generate the impetus for a community by constructing a general store, a blacksmith shop, a distillery and a tavern all within walking distance of his mills. As a result Wilson's newly arrived employees began to build their homes in close proximity to their place of work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herontrips.com/Wilson.html&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the necessary factors were in place for the community of Wilson's Mills to thrive.

By 1793 an area of land that contained Wilson's Mills was finally surveyed and officially came to be known as Ancaster Township as chosen by [[John Graves Simcoe]]. Simcoe was apparently inspired in the name choice by [[Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|Peregrine Bertie]], the 3rd Duke of [[Ancaster, Lincolnshire|Ancaster]] and [[Kesteven]].

They also widened the original native trail into what would be eventually <del class="diffchange diffchange-inline">referenced</del> as the Old Ancaster-Dundas Road in order to provide better commercial access. In 1799, William Vanderlip built a hotel that in 1844 was sold to Adam Duff which gave birth to the nickname 'Duff's Corners' for describing the well-known intersection on [[Ontario Highway 53|Highway 53]]. By 1800, native mail couriers had established between Montreal and Detroit with Ancaster appointed as the branching point for Queenston. In 1805, the Hatt brothers bought a majority of the village site from James Wilson and proceeded to subdivide it into streets and building lots. By 1810 the population of Ancaster had steadily risen to 400 residents yet in just 7 years by 1817 its populace would more than double to 1,037. In that same year Robert Gourlay carefully documented that Ancaster had 162 houses, 4 gristmills, 5 sawmills, 1 [[Carding|carding machine]], 1 [[Fulling|fulling mill]], 5 doctors, 1 Episcopalian minister, and 1 Methodist meeting house. In 1820, Job Lodor acquired the Union Mill Company and rejuvenated Ancaster's industrial base. By 1823, the first post office was established. In 1824, the Ancaster Union Church was built. By 1825, Ancaster had constructed a public reading room with papers from Niagara, York and New York. A foundry making plough shears was established in 1825 by William Wiard. In 1826, Jacob Gabel started a tannery; Robert Douglas started a brewery and John Galt established Ancaster as his headquarters for the Canada Company. 1827 marked the year that inaugurated the publication of [[George Gurnett|George Gurnett's]] Gore Gazette and the Ancaster, Hamilton, Dundas and [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]] Advertiser. By 1835, Job Lodor was the only person in Upper Canada who managed to obtain banking privileges and thus the Gore Bank was established in the village in 1836. Also in 1836, the population of Ancaster would reach 2,664. In 1837 a group of Red Coated Soldiers appeared in the village to announce the MacKenzie and Papineau rebellions. By 1840 Ancaster had 5 hotels. In 1844, Dr. Richardson opened his practice in the village. Eyre Thuresson founded a threshing machine factory in 1846, a stone mill in 1862, another card mill upstream in 1863 and reorganized the Cane Knitting Factory in 1865. In 1847, N. and E. Wiard re-opened the McLauglin foundry to make ploughs. Harris and Alonzo Egleston arrived in 1832 and began working at William Wiard's foundry and eventually bought him out. The Egleston's then proceeded to expand their own business empire which included building a foundry in 1843 employing 25 people and rebuilding a gristmill in 1863 at the present day location of the Old Ancaster Mill on the old Dundas Road. This Egleston mill was the 4th Ancaster mill and the third to be rebuilt at this current location. Wilson's original mills burnt down in 1812. Upon rebuilding, Wilson's mills were relocated from this original site at Wilson and Rousseaux Street a little further downstream and rebuilt in stone at the present Old Ancaster Mill location on Old Dundas Road. Again, at the same location, a second mill burnt down in 1818 as well as a third mill that was damaged by fire in 1854.

  <td class="diff-deletedline"><div>At the end of the 19th century, the townsfolk of Ancaster were certainly conscious that their town had once been a glowing star in Upper Canada that had quickly lost its luster during the Victorian age despite its second successful wave of industrialization in the 1820s. In 1897, local author Alma Dick-Lauder writing about Ancaster in the [[Hamilton Spectator]] using the colourful language of that time lamented that "So who can say that new life may not once more flow to the aged village, now high and dry on old time's sand banks, bringing back her bright meridian bloom and vigour of 70 years ago? Fanned by the breath of electricity to spring like a Phoenix from her bed of ashes-ashes, understand, being principally the matter choking up the old place with a fire record unequalled since the days of Sodom, making her an object of terror to her friend, derision to her foes and a hoo-doo to the guileless insurance agent. It is rather melancholy, on a summer's day, to stand on the high bridge and watch the waters slouching by like a gang of crystal dwarfs out of a job, idling and playing and painting the 'beautiful, waving hair of the dead' grass green among the fallen ruins, which a few years ago were instinct with the hum of industry, pouring forth at stated hours, with jangle of bells, a cheerful, clattering stream of bread winners, giving life and animation to the scene, in contrast to the occasional man who now meets the casual glance up street in the sunny noon hours".&lt;ref&gt;Pen and Pencil Sketches of Wentworth Landmarks, The Spectator Printing Company 1897&lt;/ref&gt; Alma Dick-Lauder was referring to the fact that by 1897, although Ancaster Township had a population of 4,000, the solitary industry that remained was Egleston's gristmill. The 'fire record' Alma refers to was the burning of the following: John J. Ryckman's store in 1841, St. Johns Church in 1868, The Ancaster Knitting Factory in 1875, the Morris S. Lowrey Hotel in 1881, Egleston's foundry in 1883, Thuresson's Foundry in 1884 and finally the Ancaster Carriage Factory in 1885. By Alma's expression the 'meridian bloom of 70 years ago' she was referring to the fact that in 1820 Job Lodor had purchased the Union Mills and in so doing had instantly transformed Ancaster's industrial center to the point where it was once again, albeit temporarily, the unrivalled commercial and industrial hub of the Gore district. At the time of Alma's 1897 newspaper article, Ancaster had gone from having three schools in 1835 to just one remaining school but had managed to develop cultural institutions such as an orchestra, a literary society and an enclosed curling rink. Job Lodor as well as many other prominent as well as lesser known early Ancaster settlers left behind sometimes still legible tombstones and <del class="diffchange diffchange-inline">gravemarkers</del> in the cemeteries belonging to St. John's Anglican and St. Andrew's Presbyterian Churches located on Wilson Street.</div></td>

<p>Ancaster is a picturesque and historic <a href="/wiki/Community" title="Community">community</a> located on the <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Escarpment" title="Niagara Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a>, within the greater area of the city of <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. This former town was founded officially in 1793 and was one of the oldest European communities established in present day <a href="/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> along with <a href="/wiki/Windsor,_Ontario" title="Windsor, Ontario">Windsor</a> (1749),<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario" title="Kingston, Ontario">Kingston</a> (1780), <a href="/wiki/St._Catharines" title="St. Catharines">St. Catharines</a> (1787–89), <a href="/wiki/Grimsby,_Ontario" title="Grimsby, Ontario">Grimsby</a> (1790), <a href="/wiki/Niagara-on-the-Lake" title="Niagara-on-the-Lake">Niagara-on-the-Lake</a> (1792) and <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> (1793).</p>
<p>By 1823, due in large part to its easily accessible water power located at the juncture of already existing historical trading routes, Ancaster had become <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a>'s largest industrial and commercial center. Additionally, Ancaster had at that time attracted the 2nd largest populace (1,681) in <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a> trailing only <a href="/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario" title="Kingston, Ontario">Kingston</a> (population 2,500),<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but surpassing the populations of nearby <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> (1,376) and <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a> (1,000).<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> After this initial period of prosperity beginning in the late 18th century, sudden significant water and rail transportation advancements of the early 19th century would soon better benefit Ancaster's neighbouring towns situated closer to the Lake Ontario waterfront. Stationary steam engines for industries were also being rapidly developed in the 19th century that would eventually make Ancaster's water powered industries less vital. As a result, after the 1820s, Ancaster's influence during the remainder of the 19th century would begin to wane.</p>
<p>From the late 19th century Ancaster's population would remain static until 1946 when new subdivisions around the village were established. The population expanded further with the completion of the Hamilton-Ancaster section of <a href="/wiki/Highway_403_(Ontario)" title="Highway 403 (Ontario)" class="mw-redirect">Highway 403</a> in 1968 and the introduction of sewer systems in 1974. After 1970, its population essentially doubled from 15,000 residents to its present-day 33,000.</p>
<p>Today, Ancaster's primary points of interest are its historical village core, its abundant recreational walking trails and its unique variety of restaurants, pubs and shops.</p>

<p>Ancaster's geography has had a very significant affect on human settlement patterns throughout its prehistory and in the present day. A highly influential geographical formation has been the <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Escarpment" title="Niagara Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a> consisting primarily of limestone formed from ancient fossilized sea organisms that spans from present day New York State through Ontario to Illinois. The escarpment itself created the water power that encouraged early European settlers to gravitate to the area in the late 1700s. However, this energy source would not have been accessible if the escarpment were not navigable. This long-meandering landform generally proved to be an inhospitable transportation barrier for thousands of years for past indigenous cultures. However, a natural break in this escarpment in the precise area that would become Ancaster village had for millennia created an opportunity for people to traverse up and down the escarpment providing a relatively easy navigable land transportation gateway from the head of the lake to the surrounding land on the escarpment and vice versa.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The creation of the <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lower_Canada" title="Lower Canada">Lower</a> Canadian provinces (colonies) from the division of the <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Quebec_(1763-1791)" title="Province of Quebec (1763-1791)" class="mw-redirect">Province of Quebec (1763-1791)</a> colony by the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain" title="Parliament of Great Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Act_of_1791" title="Constitutional Act of 1791" class="mw-redirect">Constitutional Act of 1791</a> had a deciding influence on the timing of the founding of Ancaster. At its inception, <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a> was only sparsely settled (unlike the more established <a href="/wiki/Lower_Canada" title="Lower Canada">Lower Canada</a>) and its land had not been officially surveyed to any great extent. Thus, there was an urgency by the then <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor" title="Lieutenant Governor" class="mw-redirect">Lieutenant Governor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Graves_Simcoe" title="John Graves Simcoe">John Graves Simcoe</a> to survey this new and relatively barren province for establishing military roads and for preventing settlers from clearing and settling land not legally belonging to them. Predating <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada" title="Upper Canada">Upper Canada</a>, however, the earliest European settlers to arrive and clear land in the mid-18th century in what would eventually become Ancaster were mostly a wilderness society made up of American farmers travelling north searching for arable land <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and to a lesser extent <a href="/wiki/French_language_in_Canada" title="French language in Canada">French speaking</a> <a href="/wiki/North_American_Fur_Trade" title="North American Fur Trade" class="mw-redirect">fur traders</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> immigrants travelling southward. Also arriving into this area again travelling north in substantial numbers around 1787 with the incentive of inexpensive land grants were the <a href="/wiki/United_Empire_Loyalists" title="United Empire Loyalists" class="mw-redirect">United Empire Loyalists</a> still loyal to the British crown who were fleeing from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> after the 1776 <a href="/wiki/American_War_of_Independence" title="American War of Independence" class="mw-redirect">American War of Independence</a>. Britain's promise of free land brought many people from the new republic to the south and east, who did not exhibit the same loyalty to the crown as the Loyalists. This would eventually lead to series of defections, accusations and treasonous acts during the War of 1812 that precipitated the largest mass hangings in Canadian history, the so-called <a href="/wiki/Bloody_Assizes" title="Bloody Assizes">Bloody Assizes</a> whose trial took place in Ancaster in 1814. When Upper Canada was invaded by the United States during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> its occupants were primarily of American ancestry. However, after the war the province would have a noticeably more British centered influence.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Britain expected its colonies to purchase all essential finished goods needed for day-to-day living from the mother country in exchange for raw materials such as fur and lumber. However, this 'arrangement' naturally proved to be very inefficient and impractical in practice so waterwheels, mills and factories soon hurriedly evolved in favourable towns in Upper Canada that had abundant water power, fertile soil, and good transportation access such as Ancaster that could then provide the new settlers with a good measure of self-sufficiency.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In general terms, the mindset of typical Upper Canada settlers could be described as new arrivals that "evinced any amount of dislike of the Americans but something less than love of the Mother country. The early English settlers were independent cattle, they had emigrated; not to perpetuate a mould but to escape from it. They scattered far and wide; they would seem to have selected their lands rather like rummagers at a bargain sale, by feel or look. The Loyalists were more gregarious; they thickened wherever there was good soil or waterwheel sites".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In an age before steam power, the wilderness that would become Ancaster had an early economic advantage due to the fact that it existed amidst a natural break in the <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Escarpment" title="Niagara Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a>. Thus even its relatively minor water resources were valuable because they were easily accessible. Just as vital an influence in Ancaster's rapid development was the fact that it already had access to two very important prehistoric <a href="/wiki/First_Nations" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> roads. The first European settlers to set foot in this region would have encountered the Iroquois Trail and the <a href="/wiki/Mohawk_Road_(Hamilton,_Ontario)" title="Mohawk Road (Hamilton, Ontario)">Mohawk Trail</a> intersecting precisely in the area that would eventually become Ancaster Village. This aboriginal Iroquois trail had become the most important transportation route in Upper Canada. It meandered down the escarpment from the future Ancaster into what would eventually become Hamilton, Ontario towards present day <a href="/wiki/Lewiston,_New_York" title="Lewiston, New York">Lewiston, New York</a>, eventually linking up with similar aboriginal trails in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>. In the other direction the Iroquois trail led from present day Ancaster to what would eventually become the town of <a href="/wiki/Brantford" title="Brantford">Brantford, Ontario</a> whereupon the trail then branched off into the Detroit Path and the Long Point trail. By 1770, the 80 kilometre Mohawk Trail was essentially the escarpment accompaniment of the lakeside Iroquois trail. The Mohawk Trail ran parallel to the Iroquois trail and originated and diverged from the Iroquois trail in present day <a href="/wiki/Queenston,_Ontario" title="Queenston, Ontario">Queenston, Ontario</a> until finally ending and reconnecting to the Iroquois Trail in present day Ancaster at what is now known as the intersection of Rousseaux and Wilson Street. The two trails actually interconnected in four locations along the Mohawk Trail's 80 kilometre route when favourable escarpment conditions permitted. By 1785, the Iroquois Trail passing through present day Ancaster had been widened to accommodate horse and buggy traffic. Another influential road that intersected the Mohawk Trail very close to Ancaster Village was the Twenty Mile road that followed the <a href="/wiki/Twenty_Mile_Creek" title="Twenty Mile Creek">Twenty Mile Creek</a> up to present day <a href="/wiki/Smithville,_Ontario" title="Smithville, Ontario">Smithville, Ontario</a> and beyond.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Niagara_Peninsula_1851_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Niagara_Peninsula_1851-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Lastly, Ancaster also had fertile soil and abundant fresh water which encouraged pioneer settlers to arrive in this region to clear the land and plant crops for subsistence <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>.</p>

Ancaster, 1910</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ancaster was established formally in 1792, but the area now referred to as Ancaster Village had been referred to informally by local villagers by the more colourful name of Wilson's Mills. This was in reference to millwright James Wilson who along with his affluent fur trader, entrepreneur and business partner <a href="/wiki/Richard_Beasley_(politician)" title="Richard Beasley (politician)">Richard Beasley</a> were the primary founders of Ancaster village. With Beasley’s financial backing, Wilson built a gristmill in 1791 and a sawmill in 1792 that would be the only mills west of Grimsby for many years. In order to attract workers to his mills, Wilson needed to provide the social amenities and commercial framework for an area of land which in that period was an isolated frontier forest with accessible water power situated precisely at the juncture of already well-established pre-historical indigenous transportation trails. In that period the area was populated with just a smattering of <a href="/wiki/First_Nations" title="First Nations">First Nations</a> aboriginal peoples and wilderness farmers. Again, with Beasley's financial assistance, Wilson managed to generate the impetus for a community by constructing a general store, a blacksmith shop, a distillery and a tavern all within walking distance of his mills. As a result Wilson's newly arrived employees began to build their homes in close proximity to their place of work.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and thus the necessary factors were in place for the community of Wilson's Mills to thrive. Wilson's primary residence was also used as a school, a magistrate's court and a cooperage.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> To this day, the main street that winds through the historical Ancaster Village that once was a section of the original aboriginal Iroquois Trail still bears the legacy of Wilson's name. By 1793 an area of land that contained Wilson's Mills was finally surveyed and officially came to be known as Ancaster Township as chosen by <a href="/wiki/John_Graves_Simcoe" title="John Graves Simcoe">John Graves Simcoe</a>. Simcoe was apparently inspired in the name choice by <a href="/wiki/Peregrine_Bertie,_3rd_Duke_of_Ancaster_and_Kesteven" title="Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven">Peregrine Bertie</a>, the 3rd Duke of <a href="/wiki/Ancaster,_Lincolnshire" title="Ancaster, Lincolnshire">Ancaster</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kesteven" title="Kesteven">Kesteven</a>. Thus, Wilson's Mills was indirectly renamed <a href="/wiki/Ancaster,_Lincolnshire" title="Ancaster, Lincolnshire">Ancaster</a> after an ancient village and former <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" title="Roman Britain">Roman town</a> that stills exists in the district of <a href="/wiki/Lincolnshire" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>In 1794, Wilson sold his half share of the grist-mill and sawmill business to Montreal born fur trader, interpreter, businessman, militia officer and office holder Jean Rousseaux who already had a home and general store on Wilson Street. Rousseaux's Ancaster general store was popular particularly with customers of Joseph Brant's <a href="/wiki/Six_Nations" title="Six Nations" class="mw-disambig">Six Nations</a> Mohawk's from the <a href="/wiki/Grand_River_(Ontario)" title="Grand River (Ontario)">Grand River</a>. Rousseaux would eventually buy out Beasley's remaining share of the mills in 1797. Rousseaux had also been Governor Simcoe's official interpreter and was also a close confidante and advisor to native leader <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Brant" title="Joseph Brant">Joseph Brant</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> James Wilson at this point moved away and the local villagers by 1795 gradually began referring to the community of Wilson's Mills as Ancaster Village. Curiously, the detailed whereabouts or activities of James Wilson after his departure are not well documented. There is evidence that Wilson was born before 1755, had a wife and three children but his burial location is unknown.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> With the profits from this business transaction Rousseaux built the Union Hotel in 1797 on Wilson Street, which is now remembered as the location of the <a href="/wiki/Bloody_Assize_(1814)" title="Bloody Assize (1814)">Bloody Assize</a> trials in 1814 during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>. By building his hotel on Wilson Street, Rouseaux reversed the then trend of building exclusively on the Mohawk trail. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1794-1797, Rousseaux also added a general store, brewery and distillery as well as hiring Ancaster's first school teacher. His other accomplishments being the first assessor, tax collector, magistrate and the Township's first Lieutenant Colonel of Militia. He also became a considerable land owner and assisted significantly with native relations and the development of Ancaster and York. Rousseaux eventually resold the mills to the Union Mill Company in 1802 and they ultimately were destroyed by fire in 1812. However the mills brief 20 years of service (1791-1812) had provided the initial catalyst for the economic and social development of Ancaster Township. Rousseaux died of pleurisy at Fort George (Niagara-on-the-Lake) during the war of 1812. <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1798, the <a href="/wiki/Richard_Hatt" title="Richard Hatt">Hatt</a> brothers Richard and Samuel from Dundas established their Red Mill downstream below Ancaster Falls at the base of the so called "devil's elbow". They also widened the original native trail into what would be eventually known as the Old Ancaster-Dundas Road in order to provide better commercial access. In 1799, William Vanderlip built a hotel that in 1844 was sold to Adam Duff which gave birth to the nickname 'Duff's Corners' for describing the well-known intersection on <a href="/wiki/Ontario_Highway_53" title="Ontario Highway 53">Highway 53</a>. By 1800, native mail couriers had been established between Montreal and Detroit with Ancaster appointed as the branching point for Queenston. In 1805, the Hatt brothers bought a majority of the village site from James Wilson and proceeded to subdivide it into streets and building lots. By 1810 the population of Ancaster had steadily risen to 400 residents yet in just 7 years by 1817 its populace would more than double to 1,037. In that same year Robert Gourlay carefully documented that Ancaster had 162 houses, 4 gristmills, 5 sawmills, 1 <a href="/wiki/Carding" title="Carding">carding machine</a>, 1 <a href="/wiki/Fulling" title="Fulling">fulling mill</a>, 5 doctors, 1 Episcopalian minister, and 1 Methodist meeting house. In 1820, Job Lodor acquired the Union Mill Company and rejuvenated Ancaster's industrial base. By 1823, the first post office was established. In 1824, the Ancaster Union Church was built. By 1825, Ancaster had constructed a public reading room with papers from Niagara, York and New York. A foundry making plough shears was established in 1825 by William Wiard. In 1826, Jacob Gabel started a tannery; Robert Douglas started a brewery and John Galt established Ancaster as his headquarters for the Canada Company. 1827 marked the year that inaugurated the publication of <a href="/wiki/George_Gurnett" title="George Gurnett">George Gurnett's</a> Gore Gazette and the Ancaster, Hamilton, Dundas and <a href="/wiki/Flamborough,_Ontario" title="Flamborough, Ontario">Flamborough</a> Advertiser. By 1835, Job Lodor was the only person in Upper Canada who managed to obtain banking privileges and thus the Gore Bank was established in the village in 1836. Also in 1836, the population of Ancaster would reach 2,664. In 1837 a group of Red Coated Soldiers appeared in the village to announce the MacKenzie and Papineau rebellions. By 1840 Ancaster had 5 hotels. In 1844, Dr. Richardson opened his practice in the village. Eyre Thuresson founded a threshing machine factory in 1846, a stone mill in 1862, another card mill upstream in 1863 and reorganized the Cane Knitting Factory in 1865. In 1847, N. and E. Wiard re-opened the McLauglin foundry to make ploughs. Harris and Alonzo Egleston arrived in 1832 and began working at William Wiard's foundry and eventually bought him out. The Egleston's then proceeded to expand their own business empire which included building a foundry in 1843 employing 25 people and rebuilding a gristmill in 1863 at the present day location of the Old Ancaster Mill on the old Dundas Road. This Egleston mill was the 4th Ancaster mill and the third to be rebuilt at this current location. Wilson's original mills burnt down in 1812. Upon rebuilding, Wilson's mills were relocated from this original site at Wilson and Rousseaux Street a little further downstream and rebuilt in stone at the present Old Ancaster Mill location on Old Dundas Road. Again, at the same location, a second mill burnt down in 1818 as well as a third mill that was damaged by fire in 1854. Wilson's original 1791-1792 mill foundations still exist 75 yards upstream from the Wilson and Rousseaux Street intersection but are hidden with vegetation. The much restored and modified remnants of Egleston's 1854 mill now operates as a restaurant and banquet hall. The Barracks of 1812 still stand as a reminder of the war of 1812. By May 1866, the first public telephone was set up in Gurnett's store but was disconnected from lack of use.</p>
<p>By 1869, Ancaster was a Village in the Township of Ancaster County Wentworth with a population of 500. Mr. K. Thuresson turned out <a href="/wiki/Carding" title="Carding">card clothing</a>. The Ancaster Knitting Company employed over 100 in the manufacture of knitted goods. Messrs. H &amp; A Egleston manufactured agricultural implements, cotton and woolen machinery. Mr. A Egleston employed 20 in woolen and cloth mills.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1871 the still existing and currently well maintained Ancaster Township Hall opened at a cost of $2,400. Additional examples of Victorian architecture are also located on Wilson Street, amongst them the Richardson residence, which was built in 1872 as a wedding present for Dr. Henry Richardson and his new bride Sarah Egleston. Other similar structures includes St. John's Church 1869, the Gurnett home 1826, Gurnett General Store 1826, Hammill house 1860, the Egleston house, Job Lodor's home 1820, Rousseau Hotel 1832 and the Thuresson home 1872 to name just a few. The oldest building in Ancaster is the Tisdale house at 314 Wilson Street which was built circa 1806 and whose current function is a police museum. The traveling expedition of Edison's magical <a href="/wiki/Edison_Records" title="Edison Records">phonograph</a> was exhibited in the Township Hall in 1878. In 1891, John Heslop was murdered in his home on Mineral Springs Road and the murder case remains unsolved to this day. After 1900, affluent Hamilton industrialists began purchasing farm land close to Ancaster village for building estates. By 1946, housing subdivisions began to be established around the village and thus began the post-<a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> population expansion that continues to this present day with the current housing construction in the <a href="/wiki/Meadowlands,_Hamilton" title="Meadowlands, Hamilton">Meadowlands</a> subdivision.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Ancaster's dominant position in the region as an influential industrial, commercial and farming community throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries would soon be short-lived due to sudden modern transportation advancements in its neighbouring towns. Soon nearby <a href="/wiki/Dundas,_Ontario" title="Dundas, Ontario">Dundas</a> and a small farm settlement close to the lakefront that by 1833 would be established as the town of <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">Hamilton</a> would soon become more influential mainly because of the successful completion of the following three transportation projects: the completion of the Burlington Canal in 1832 that connected <a href="/wiki/Burlington_Bay" title="Burlington Bay" class="mw-redirect">Burlington Bay</a> (Hamilton Harbour) to <a href="/wiki/Lake_Ontario" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Desjardins_Canal" title="Desjardins Canal">Desjardins Canal</a> in 1837 that enabled lake vessels to enter nearby <a href="/wiki/Dundas,_Ontario" title="Dundas, Ontario">Dundas</a> through Hamilton Harbour and the completion in 1855 of The <a href="/wiki/Great_Western_Railway_(Ontario)" title="Great Western Railway (Ontario)">Great Western Railway</a> connection to Hamilton (and eventually Dundas) enabled Hamilton, which already had flourishing and expanding ports, to become the prominent urban and commercial settlement in the region. Another factor in Ancaster's gradual economic decline was that stationary steam engines by the 1840's had begun powering industries thus locating industries adjacent to water power was less vital. In fact by this time even Ancaster had started to introduce steam power however Hamilton's natural harbour gave it a tremendous advantage. <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>A final contributing factor to Hamilton's dominance was the fact it was chosen to be the administrative center for the new Gore District in 1816<sup id="cite_ref-The_Niagara_Peninsula_1851_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Niagara_Peninsula_1851-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> and was voted to be the county town instead of Ancaster.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the 19th century Ancaster became an unimposing <a href="/wiki/Gristmill" title="Gristmill">gristmill</a> hamlet and <a href="/wiki/Police_village" title="Police village">police village</a>. Ancaster would not have access to a modern transportation system until the <a href="/wiki/Brantford_and_Hamilton_Electric_Railway" title="Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway">Brantford and Hamilton Electric Railway</a> intersected Ancaster Village in 1907. The advent of the B&amp;H radial line radically began the process of change to the character of Ancaster that is clearly recognizable today from a somewhat isolated yet self-sufficient village to its current status as a bedroom community of Hamilton. Interestingly, the evidence for this radial train is still easily visible in Ancaster village by a well maintained gravel path behind St. John's Anglican Church on Wilson Street. Walkers and cyclists can still follow this old radial line path down the escarpment to the Hamilton Chedoke Golf Course. The radial line was dismantled in 1931 as a condition of sale from the Cataract Company. With the advent of competition from the automobile and bus companies in North America at the turn of the 20th century, generally only publicly owned streetcar companies had the financial means to survive into the 1950s.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, the townsfolk of Ancaster were certainly conscious that their town had once been a glowing star in Upper Canada that had quickly lost its luster during the Victorian age despite its second successful wave of industrialization in the 1820s. In 1897, local author Alma Dick-Lauder writing about Ancaster in the <a href="/wiki/Hamilton_Spectator" title="Hamilton Spectator" class="mw-redirect">Hamilton Spectator</a> using the colourful language of that time lamented that "So who can say that new life may not once more flow to the aged village, now high and dry on old time's sand banks, bringing back her bright meridian bloom and vigour of 70 years ago? Fanned by the breath of electricity to spring like a Phoenix from her bed of ashes-ashes, understand, being principally the matter choking up the old place with a fire record unequalled since the days of Sodom, making her an object of terror to her friend, derision to her foes and a hoo-doo to the guileless insurance agent. It is rather melancholy, on a summer's day, to stand on the high bridge and watch the waters slouching by like a gang of crystal dwarfs out of a job, idling and playing and painting the 'beautiful, waving hair of the dead' grass green among the fallen ruins, which a few years ago were instinct with the hum of industry, pouring forth at stated hours, with jangle of bells, a cheerful, clattering stream of bread winners, giving life and animation to the scene, in contrast to the occasional man who now meets the casual glance up street in the sunny noon hours".<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Alma Dick-Lauder was referring to the fact that by 1897, although Ancaster Township had a population of 4,000, the solitary industry that remained was Egleston's gristmill. The 'fire record' Alma refers to was the burning of the following: John J. Ryckman's store in 1841, St. Johns Church in 1868, The Ancaster Knitting Factory in 1875, the Morris S. Lowrey Hotel in 1881, Egleston's foundry in 1883, Thuresson's Foundry in 1884 and finally the Ancaster Carriage Factory in 1885. By Alma's expression the 'meridian bloom of 70 years ago' she was referring to the fact that in 1820 Job Lodor had purchased the Union Mills and in so doing had instantly transformed Ancaster's industrial center to the point where it was once again, albeit temporarily, the unrivalled commercial and industrial hub of the Gore district. At the time of Alma's 1897 newspaper article, Ancaster had gone from having three schools in 1835 to just one remaining school but had managed to develop cultural institutions such as an orchestra, a literary society and an enclosed curling rink. Job Lodor as well as many other prominent as well as lesser known early Ancaster settlers left behind sometimes still legible tombstones and grave markers in the cemeteries belonging to St. John's Anglican and St. Andrew's Presbyterian Churches located on Wilson Street.</p>
<p>According to Dick-Lauder's late 19th century description of Job Lodor, "Somewhere about the year of grace 1820, the 'man-of-the-time' came and took up his abode in the village where he henceforth lived and where he died and is buried, after having contributed much to the advancement of Ancaster in many ways. This enterprising pioneer was named Job Loder, and he was the builder and owner of all the mills and water privileges of the whole place for many years, running grist mills, saw mill, carding and woolen mills all along the stream on the site of the present ruins. Mr Loder also had a general store close to his house in the village, where he did a running business, giving constant employment to four clerks. Finally the old gentlemen made so much money that he didn't know what to do with it, so he sold out his mills and water privileges to a person named [Mr.] Russell".<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the same period in 1897, what would have been a common shared experience of travelling up the escarpment to Ancaster on horseback was fancifully described, "It is a royal progress, that gradual ascent to Ancaster, and even the nobodies must turn their head in right royal fashion from side to side to greet the 'woodsey smell' of the mossy fern carpet spread over the rocks there in the shade to catch a breath from 'the far off greenhouses of God' to look deep into the rocky gorge where the bridge crosses over a real Hieland stream foaming down in haste after rains, round boulders and over hollow to join fortunes with the Yuba (nickname of Ancaster's main stream) hastening from its work above at Ancaster. Just here the road begins to crawl and so do the horses, giving time to enjoy all the beauteous vale of the fountains, which lies revealed, perhaps in level beams of evening, to the never satisfied eye. Presumably it was good luck and water privileges, more that inherent good taste, which led the earliest forefathers of the hamlet to form a nucleus at Ancaster, but it is hard to imagine, looking back from the turn of the mountain, how they could possibly have made a better selection ... It would appear also that there has always been an unusual percentage of good looks amongst the Ancastrians in days gone by, as well as today".<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Fiddler's Green road was apparently not named after a place or person but rather an activity. It turns out that by the late 19th century, Fiddler's Green was Ancaster's tawdry and hence very popular entertainment center once located in precisely the area between present day Ravina Court and Douglas Street. In more recent times this area was a busy hive of activity every Monday as the Ancaster Auction barn was active there until as recently as 1985. During auction Mondays, it was not an uncommon site to see farmers tackling runaway piglets or rounding up stray calves on surrounding house properties. However even during this latter period when this land was used as an auction for hogs and cattle, the remnants of an old race track on the premises was still easily visible. However, 100 years ago, this area was "a place where fiddlers would gather and perform at what was known as the Fiddler's Green Inn, a popular place for musicians to come and perform. The area was popular for horse racing and drinking, which in turn attracted more spectators, a common stop over or a communications point. As a great number of travelers visited the area, like any other port of call, the taverns and the inns sprang up".<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Ancaster Fair has been an annual agricultural and social event since 1850 except for 1937 when it was cancelled due to a case of infantile paralysis. Originally the fair was held at Wilson and Academy Streets in the Village core. In 1894 it moved to Wilson and Cameron Drive driving park where it remained until its centennial year in 1950 when it moved to Garner Road. After nearly 60 years at the Garner Road site, the Ancaster Fair in 2009 has moved to 630 Trinity Road.</p>
<p>In 1976, an Ancaster Town Council vote reversed a long-standing policy that would finally allow Ancaster restaurants to apply for liquor licenses. Other than the <a href="/wiki/LCBO" title="LCBO" class="mw-redirect">LCBO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brewers_Retail" title="Brewers Retail" class="mw-redirect">Brewers Retail</a> outlets that were established in Ancaster in the 1950s, the village had up to that point been 'dry', presumably since <a href="/wiki/Prohibition_in_Canada" title="Prohibition in Canada">Prohibition in Canada</a>. Ancaster's earlier pioneers however experienced an entirely different social environment. Again according to Dick-Lauder writing in 1897, "Ancaster saw plenty of life during the <a href="/wiki/Upper_Canada_Rebellion" title="Upper Canada Rebellion">rebellion of 1837</a>, when it was quite a frequent thing for all the inns, five in number, and many of the private houses to be full over night of redcoats passing towards the west".</p>

<p>When it became part of the <a href="/wiki/Hamilton-Wentworth_Regional_Municipality,_Ontario" title="Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality, Ontario" class="mw-redirect">Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth</a> in 1974, the Town of Ancaster absorbed the Township of Ancaster (including other hamlets like Jerseyville, Lynden and Alberton).

<p>It was amalgamated with the nearby <a href="/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario" title="Hamilton, Ontario">City of Hamilton</a> in 2001.
