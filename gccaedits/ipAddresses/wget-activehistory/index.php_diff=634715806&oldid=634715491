<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ohio_and_Tennessee">Ohio and Tennessee</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't Ohio and Tennessee be listed as states legalizing SSM with stayed rulings? Shouldn't they also be in the table of cases with stayed rulings pending appeal. Both of these cases were heard by the the 6th Ciruit, and both Justices stated the laws were unconstitutional. They both stayed further rulings pending appeal. Any ruling the 6th Circuit makes will directly affect all four states. Unlike in the 9th and 4th circuits. --<a href="/wiki/User:Celtic_hackr" title="User:Celtic hackr">Celtic hackr</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Celtic_hackr" title="User talk:Celtic hackr">talk</a>) 05:57, 15 October 2014 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, they should. <a href="/wiki/User:Laikalynx" title="User:Laikalynx">Laikalynx</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Laikalynx" title="User talk:Laikalynx">talk</a>) 18:42, 17 October 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In TN, the judge did not issue any order about recognizing SSM generally. He issued an order that applied only to the three plaintiff couples. So no for Tennessee, since there's no stayed ruling that would apply state-wide if allowed to go into effect. In Ohio I think the judge's order was only about birth and death certificates and (at most) about recognizing marriages from other jurisdictions. What happens when the 6th Circuit rules should be interesting. <a href="/wiki/User:Bmclaughlin9" title="User:Bmclaughlin9">Bmclaughlin9</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bmclaughlin9" title="User talk:Bmclaughlin9">talk</a>) 18:59, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, that the judge's injunction was for just the three couples. But the ruling applies to the law itself and the Constitutinal amendment. Once the appeals process is exhausted, if not overturned, the ruling will apply state-wide. Hence a court has ruled SSM legal in Tennesee, but issued an injunction for just the couples involved. It's a peculiar order. The ruling applies state-wide, but the injunction only for three couples. Therefore it is my conclusion that the Federal Tennessee court has ruled SSM legal pending appeal. The Tennesse case was heard along with the other cases, and will be ruled on by the Circuit at the same time. It makes no sense to leave the Tennessee state as "banned" and the other three as "Judicial rulings overturning...". The court has ruled, the appeal heard, and awaiting the 6th Circuit to publish it's opinion. In Ohio, there were two cases and in one case the laws were ruled unconstitutional. Ohio is no longer about just the death certificate. All four states are about full SSM rights, and all four should be treated the same. The stayed injunctions are not the controlling factor. The ruling of the legality of the laws at issue is the controlling factor. If a law is ruled illegal or unconstitutional it is struck down. Period. <a href="/wiki/User:Celtic_hackr" title="User:Celtic hackr">Celtic hackr</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Celtic_hackr" title="User talk:Celtic hackr">talk</a>) 16:03, 21 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would anyone be interested in created an animated image showing the evolution and spread of rights across the map? It would ideally resemble this animated US map of statehood. <a class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_states_by_date_of_statehood3.gif">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_states_by_date_of_statehood3.gif</a> The evolution of the map, of the legal status by each state of SSM, I think is absolutely fascinating, separate from SSM specifically, but the larger umbrella of how a culture defines itself here an now, and how political rights and ideas spread. I think it would be very informative animation about the process of national consensus on civil rights. Is there a better place to direct this question?

<dd>Very nice idea. Would you want every step animated (i.e. from the first statue and/or constitutional bans to striking down to stays to full legality) or just legality (so starting with Massachusetts and continuing down the line)? <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 10:36, 11 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be cool. Would it be possible to have some compromise between the one-tick-per-event version seen on the statehood map, and a simple linear timeline (i.e., each year is two seconds)? Because the one tick per event loses the sense of how slow things were and how rapid things like the past week are, but a strict timeline either takes forever or reduces some interesting periods of a lot happening into single simultaneous events. (But anything would be good, I'm not trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good here.) --<a href="/wiki/User:NatGertler" title="User:NatGertler">Nat Gertler</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:NatGertler" title="User talk:NatGertler">talk</a>) 14:32, 11 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd be willing to try my hand at making this, but what would be the general idea that people want to see? Just marriage legality, so a list of 29 or so images with every state changing as it goes, or everything from the repealing of sodomy laws to the legality of civil unions and limited rights to full marriage equality like is happening now? <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 00:07, 13 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ideally, I would want to see variations of a single color, to represent a single continuity of possibilities. Sodomy laws are a bit of a red herring in this; they are parallel to but not directly overlapping with the marriage question. So I'd want to see something like this:
<ul>
<li>White: State with a constitutional or voter-approved ban on SSM, and no civil unions (or domestic partnerships or other marriagesque statuses)</li>
<li>Light green: State without a constitutional or voter-approved ban on SSM, but without SSM or civil unions</li>
<li>Medium green: State with civil unions but not SSM</li>
<li>Solid green: State that grants SSM</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Than means skipping things like "stayed rulings", just so we can stay on a single clear axis; introducing multiple colors rather than just depth of color I think will confuse rather than help create a clear visual representation of what has been going on (I have no idea how that flies with accessibility concerns.) If I were to add one more color, it would be between "medium" and "solid", for states that recognize but do not grant SSM. I suggest green simply because it doesn't have the political implications of red or blue; I'm not saying such implications would be utterly invalid, but it's not needed. --<a href="/wiki/User:NatGertler" title="User:NatGertler">Nat Gertler</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:NatGertler" title="User talk:NatGertler">talk</a>) 00:28, 13 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't yet, but I managed to gather the information about dates of bans, civil unions, and full equality. I was just wondering how to transition them, if they would be done by year, by state or by ruling, or some other fashion. For example, California had its first ruling for equality and the subsequent prop 8 ban within a single year, so there would be a very brief window for transition in the animation. Maybe a year in 4 seconds, so there are 3 months per second? Or would that be excessively slow if you count from 1992 (when DC allowed domestic partnerships)? <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 10:06, 17 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I made an animated map, but I'd like people's input about it before it is used elsewhere. Be gentle, this is my first time ever making an animated gif, but please let me know what you think of issues like colour choice and transition speed, or anything else you feel is important. I have a legend on the Commons page, not sure how to add one here as well. Thanks for your input, folks!</p>

Someone went back and changed this without consulting the talk page. I have went through and fixed this. Please do not revert. The ordering that was on before my fix was insane.

<li>The reason it was accepted was because it's the right edit. When a court or whatever grants same-sex marriage the things that matters is when the state starts issuing same-sex marriage. I put them in the correct order of the state when those states started issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Just because a state has legalized same-sex marriage doesn't matter. What matters is issuing same-sex marriage. The effective date of the legalization is more important than when it was issues. Also there are states like Utah that issues marriage licenses and those where still recognized by the federal government. That means Utah should behind New Mexico in terms of legalization. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AHC300&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AHC300 (page does not exist)">AHC300</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHC300" title="User talk:AHC300">talk</a>) 12:30, 18 October 2014 (UTC)

Your edit got washed in a sea of edits (and worse without an edit summary). People didn't catch your edit, which is why it lasted as long as it did. More importantly, if your edit did have consensus, then someone would have reverted my fix.

<li>I disagree. It makes the most sense to either order by (1) the date the statute became law or decision was made on the merits in the last relevant court, or (2) the date from which marriage was permanently available, i.e., the date the statute took effect or the last stay, if any, was lifted.

I could have reverted the change, just as any editor could have, but chose not to. I was busy reverting another series of edits that were part of that large block of unreviewed edits and did not want to put the time into reviewing the effects of the changes and whether they violated a pre-existing consensus (as appears to be the case) or made any sense at all. With respect to changes I didn't necessarily agree with, but was not in a strong position to judge, my choice to do nothing aside from accepting them was in line with the guidance given at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Reviewing" title="Wikipedia:Reviewing">WP:Reviewing</a>. -<a href="/wiki/User:Rrius" title="User:Rrius">Rrius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rrius" title="User talk:Rrius">talk</a>) 16:06, 18 October 2014 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would go by the date of the initial (earliest) affirmative ruling of the case that got carried through the entire court hierarchy until legalisation took place, and not the date of the latest ruling. This would put both Utah and Oklahoma before Oregon, for example, as Utah had an initial ruling of December 20, 2013, Oklahoma had a ruling on January 14, 2014, and Oregon had a ruling on May 19, 2014. The fact that the Utah and Oklahoma rulings were stayed and appealed does not deter from the fact that those rulings (by Judge Shelby and Judge Kern, respectively) were the ones that ultimately led to marriage equality in those states, as those two cases (Kitchen and Bishop) were the ones that went the full way up the ladder. <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 00:03, 19 October 2014 (UTC)</li>
<li>To be clear, I was referring to either option one or option two as sensible choices. I think the proposed change puts undo emphasis on "window marriages", some of which are not recognized by the relevant state, even if they are recognized by the federal government. That puts us in the position of potentially having to research into the state's position on window marriages to figure out where to put some states. What's more, we have columns for two dates: when the legal event occurred, and when the legal event took effect. Why on earth would we order states by some other date? Using the proposed order would only lead to our having to revert editors who well-meaningly try to put the states back in order based on the dates we actually do display. And adding two more columns to show window start and end dates is just too much for this table. The Notes column is squished as it is. -<a href="/wiki/User:Rrius" title="User:Rrius">Rrius</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rrius" title="User talk:Rrius">talk</a>) 00:06, 19 October 2014 (UTC)</li>
<li>I strong object to organizing it by date of enactment/ruling because it makes states like mine (Pennsylvania) below Illinois. Illinois did NOT legalize gay marriage in Nov. 2013. It was June 1, 2014 that gay marriage was legalized nationwide. Saying otherwise is kinda of insulting to the people of my state.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AHC300&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AHC300 (page does not exist)">AHC300</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHC300" title="User talk:AHC300">talk</a>) 01:40, 19 October 2014 (UTC)

<li>Illinois signed the bill before there was a ruling in Pennsylvania, so Illinois had legality first. Ergo, Illinois should be listed first.

<li>So what? The bill was signed in Nov 2013. That doesn't mean gay marriage was legal there. PA had a federal judge strike it down on May 20, 2014 and Illinois became legal on June 1, 2014. So you are wrong. Illinois did not legalize it first because PA was issuing gay marriages before Illinois. All that matters is when the marriages start becoming issues. Don't Ask Don't Tell wasn't repealed in Dec 2010 when Obama signed the bill into law. It was September 2011 when it was repealed.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AHC300&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AHC300 (page does not exist)">AHC300</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AHC300" title="User talk:AHC300">talk</a>) 02:24, 19 October 2014 (UTC)

<li>Despite the legislation setting a start date of June 1, 2014, marriages began on February 21, 2014 in Illinois after a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman. Therefore any argument between Illinois and Pennsylvania/Oregon being listed first shouldn't matter since both court rulings came after marriages actually began in Illinois. <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/2601:6:1E00:F4C:706E:AD69:BE31:CF6F" title="Special:Contributions/2601:6:1E00:F4C:706E:AD69:BE31:CF6F">2601:6:1E00:F4C:706E:AD69:BE31:CF6F</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2601:6:1E00:F4C:706E:AD69:BE31:CF6F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:2601:6:1E00:F4C:706E:AD69:BE31:CF6F (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:48, 20 October 2014 (UTC)</span></li>
<li>The signing of the bill is far less important than its effective date. That's was <i>effective</i> means. By contrast, the phrase you use "had legality" doesn't make sense -- "had legality" but no same-sex marriage was recognize and no same-sex couple get a marriage license. "Had legality" is a very strange concept. Similarly, MA did not have SSM in early 2004 while waiting for the court decision to take effect. We didn't "have legality".

<dd>My point exactly. If performance date is chosen, we'll have to reorder the list to ensure accuracy.

I pointed this out (<i>before someone idiotically brings it up, California is in no way homologous to OK/WI/IN/etc. The marriages in 2011 in CA were started and stopped by independent legal actions, unlike the stay debacles in the other states.</i>) and I still get this response... Utah/Wisconsin/Indiana/etc. where marriages leaked out before a stay was put in to place are in no way analogous to California where the State SC ordered SSM, and then a reactionary later-determined-unconstitutional state constitutional amendment temporarily ceased SSM. Also, if UT/etc. get a double row for the pre-stay marriages, then IA and NM logically would need them too. Iowa is perfectly homologous to some of the pre-stay marriage states. New Mexico had legally recognized SSM in 2004, so it would logically be first. <a href="/wiki/User:Thegreyanomaly" title="User:Thegreyanomaly">Thegreyanomaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thegreyanomaly" title="User talk:Thegreyanomaly">talk</a>) 01:12, 20 October 2014 (UTC)

Even if only one county issued marriage licenses on a particular day, and those licenses were recognised by the state, then that date should go into the table if we go by date of effect. Also, Alaska went into effect on a weekend, and it was only the Monday after that people could apply for licenses, so should we list Alaska on the Monday instead?

<li>California established SSM based on the <s>unstayable</s>unappealable decision of its highest court that the California Constitution would not allow a statutory SSM ban (<i><a href="/wiki/In_re_Marriage_Cases" title="In re Marriage Cases">In re Marriage Cases</a></i>); the right to SSM was revoked by a completely different entity (the passage of Proposition 8). The right to SSM in the window states was only because judges (stupidly) failed to stay their rulings. The SSM windows in their state were merely present due to the time it took to get a stay put in place. The start and stop of SSM were not due to independent actions. <a href="/wiki/User:Thegreyanomaly" title="User:Thegreyanomaly">Thegreyanomaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thegreyanomaly" title="User talk:Thegreyanomaly">talk</a>) 16:58, 21 October 2014 (UTC)</li>

<li>Option #2 does not make sense. I was married in California in 2008, and my marriage was never determined to be illegal. To say that California legalized ssm in 2013 is not correct. It was legalized in 2008, and then <i>new</i> ss marriages were prohibited by a law that was found to be unconstitutional. Striking down the 2008 proposition made the 2008 ruling the prevailing law. How do you define "permanent" when talking about law? It seems to me that we only have two choices -- either we order by the date of the ruling or legislative action that was ultimately upheld to make ssm legal, or we order by the date that the ruling went into effect. We have to choose one of these, because they are the only two dates that are in our chart. If we were to choose any other date (like the date that the first marriage license was issued) we'd be ordering the chart in an unexplained way. This would just asking for trouble, as editors passing by would most likely assume that someone had messed up the chart and try to reorder it and "fix" it. To remedy this, you would have to add a column for the date when the first ssm license was issued. I don't think this is workable, as there is so much variation and inconsistency around the date of first issuance. Would you count Utah from before or after the stay? How about the states where just one or a very small handful of licenses were issued? What about the counties that issued SSM licenses before the rest of the state? (I got a marriage license from San Francisco in 2004!) I don't think this third option is workable. So we have to pick either the date that court decision / legislative action, or the date of implementation. Either way is possible, but I think the former (bullet 1) is better. The main reason I think so, is because it is the date that is historically more important and more interesting. The date a court, electorate, or legislature decided the issue was the date that it was big news. The date of implementation is less relevant and less news worthy. For example, When Illinois made the decision it was major news. When it went into effect is was minor news. However, If anyone can cite consistent third party sources that lists the states one way over the other, I would find that to be a good reason to choose that approach. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Sam/R" title="User:Sam/R" class="mw-redirect">☑</a> <b><a href="/wiki/User:Sam" title="User:Sam">Sam</a></b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sam" title="User talk:Sam"><font color="#CCCCFF">uelWantman</font></a> 01:45, 21 October 2014 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the original legalization of SSM in California and legalization of SSM in all other judicial ruling states, we use the date for the last ruling on the merits of the case. A ruling on the merits of the case is a ruling that actually rules on same-sex marriage as opposed to a ruling on some legal procedure. For example, in the Proposition 8 case, the SCOTUS ruling on <a href="/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry" title="Hollingsworth v. Perry">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> did not rule on whether SSM should be legal, they just ruled that prop 8 proponents were never allowed to appeal; thus for California's second line we use Walker's district court ruling date (as that is the only valid ruling on the merits of the case). In every other case, the merits of SSM were addressed, so the merits of the case isn't really a variable to think about. For Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana,... the last ruling on the cases (which all ruled on the merits of the respective cases) were in June, July, and September, not December/January/February. <a href="/wiki/User:Thegreyanomaly" title="User:Thegreyanomaly">Thegreyanomaly</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Thegreyanomaly" title="User talk:Thegreyanomaly">talk</a>) 20:23, 23 October 2014 (UTC)

<dd>I think we are in agreement. My initial position (way up higher on the page) which I reiterated just above, is that the first date should be the date decision that ultimately decided the case (after any stays were lifted), and this would usually be the appeals court decision. The second date would be the date that the court set for SSM to go into effect. If there were two decisions that led to SSM going into effect (like in CA) there would be two entries. So yes, Utah's first date would be December 2013, and Oklahoma would be January 2014.-- <a href="/wiki/User:Sam/R" title="User:Sam/R" class="mw-redirect">☑</a> <b><a href="/wiki/User:Sam" title="User:Sam">Sam</a></b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sam" title="User talk:Sam"><font color="#CCCCFF">uelWantman</font></a> 18:02, 23 October 2014 (UTC)

However, if a court just discusses and decides to lift a stay, the previous date would be the one we use. If a court decides that the decision from a previous decision made about a different state now applies to another, it would be new date not the previous one. -- <a href="/wiki/User:Sam/R" title="User:Sam/R" class="mw-redirect">☑</a> <b><a href="/wiki/User:Sam" title="User:Sam">Sam</a></b><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sam" title="User talk:Sam"><font color="#CCCCFF">uelWantman</font></a> 15:44, 24 October 2014 (UTC)</dd>

For those worried about being superfluous, there are better cuts we could make (like one of the 3 or 4 maps of the US, at least two of which are only minimally different in purpose; isn't one map showing where SSM is legal enough?). This, on the other hand, seems like a good way to streamline and contrast information in table form. It's a needed balance and counterpoint to the table showing where SSM is legal. It's also more pertinent and definitive than the table showing where SSM is pending. --<a href="/wiki/User:Downthewikiwormhole" title="User:Downthewikiwormhole">Downthewikiwormhole</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Downthewikiwormhole" title="User talk:Downthewikiwormhole">talk</a>) 22:05, 22 October 2014 (UTC)</li>

<li>Question: would territories be included..? If so, what do we do about the territories with no law for or against..? <a href="/wiki/User:Prcc27" title="User:Prcc27">Prcc27</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Prcc27" title="User talk:Prcc27">talk</a>) 06:16, 23 October 2014 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, territories should be included as they are part of the US, but I'd keep them together in a separate table for now. So far, there is no territory with SSM legality, so columns are easy to apply, and in the "notes" section, it can be stated whether there is no law for or against. Once territories start legalising, we can add columns that show legal and effective dates, or we can move them to the main tables if necessary. DC was incorporated into the main table despite not being a state, so I don't see why that cannot be done with territories once the time comes.<br />
If that would make things too convoluted, I'd suggest placing Puerto Rico and the remaining territory with a ban (can't remember which one it is, the Virgin Islands?) in the "banned" table, and the remaining ones in a new "no law" table, which will likely disappear over time. <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 10:51, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

<p>I just read the text of the decision, and I believe the decision is in conflict, and provides no direction outside St. Louis.

A few other counties have already decided to issue licenses.<br />
The decision paves the way for equality in Missouri, but it is indeed quite narrow in its effect for now. <i>Jus vigilantibus scriptum est</i>, however, so thus far, not all of Missouri will be affected until there is a wider ruling. <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 12:41, 6 November 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, St. Louis County is not a "rogue county". The ruling declared the law preventing them from issuing such licenses unconstituional.

<dd>The ruling also states that "Defendant and any future Recorder of Deeds and Vital Records Registrar of the City of St. Louis has the authority to issue marriage licenses".

This means that, while the ban is effectively void in all of Missouri, only the St. Louis City clerk can issue licenses for now. If any other clerks issue them, they go against the ruling, as they are not mentioned. The mandate will have to encompass the issuing rights of all of Missouri's clerks before the rest can issue. Thus, by those criteria, clerks from St. Louis County have no legal right to issue licenses, and are therefore rogue. <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 23:40, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

<dd>There is some relevance to the statement about "rogue" clerks. The issue is complex, as can be seen by reading the Jackson opinion and ruling. The US District judge clearly states he "cannot grant" all county clerks relief as only a county clerk was named in the suit (the state was not named, i.e. the AG or Gov.). The same is not true for the St. Louis case. The St. Louis case lists "The State of Missouri" as the plaintiff (meaning the AG brought the case), which makes the ruling applicable state wide. The Jackson case invalidates SSM bans for the entire state, but can only "grant relief" in Jackson County. The St. Louis case only "orders" the St. Louis registrar to allow marriages. But since it is a State judge ruling as and for the entire State it is a statewide ruling. This is not an individual suing the state, but the state suing an individual. The ruling applies to every county. Basically, this ruling is only saying "hey you are breaking the laws you've sworn to uphold if you don't grant licenses". Basically, the St. Louis City clerk is being called out as a rogue clerk if she does not grant, even though she was prosecuted originally for being a rogue clerk "for granting" them. The suit kind of backfired on the State. Poetic, isn't it? So this order should NOT be read as a "relief" for just the City clerk but as a "warning" that ALL clerks, especially the City of St. Louis clerk, need to grant them. This was a different sort of case from most of the others. You have to consider who the parties at suit are. Who the "plaintiff" is and who the "defendent" is. It's all relevent. <a href="/wiki/User:Celtic_hackr" title="User:Celtic hackr">Celtic hackr</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Celtic_hackr" title="User talk:Celtic hackr">talk</a>) 15:44, 15 November 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The yellow is specifically for rulings against the bans that would be in effect, if there wasn't a current stay pending appeal.

<p>Somebody changed Kansas back to striped, blue and red. I realized that some counties are slow in issuing licenses, due to misdirection from the Kansas AG, but red is inappropriate. I guess we need a new color for contempt of court.</p>

<p>Gay marriage is legal in Kansas:</p>
<p>Kansas is subject to the precedents set when the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Oklahoma.</p>
<p>A U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction against the state's ban on same-sex marriage, which became effective on November 12, 2014, after Supreme Court declined to intervene.["Supreme Court allows gay marriage to proceed in Kansas - kfgo.com". Reuters. November 12, 2014. Retrieved November 12, 2014.] The case is still subject to appeal.</p>
<p>Some counties have not issued licences to same-sex couples, and state government agencies are not taking actions to recognize same-sex marriages.["Kansas agencies not recognizing gay marriages yet - ljworld.com". AP. November 20, 2014. Retrieved November 20, 2014.]</p>
<p>SCOTUS has ruled that Kansas cannot enforce its ban.</p>
<p>The "States that license same-sex marriage" should be updated to include Kansas, no?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If only it was that simple. There have been a number of states that ignored circuit precedent and persisted with their own court cases (Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Alaska, Arizona, North and South Carolina), so precedence is not a sign that a state actually follows it. Also, the Attorney General in Kansas is trying to put his foot down and claims the ruling only affected a few counties, so correct legal information is difficult to come by. It's just delaying tactics though, they can't win this. Trying to dishearten people within sight of the finishing line, just legal bullying. I would call this contempt of court, but I'm not a legally trained person, so we'll see where it leads. <a href="/wiki/User:Kumorifox" title="User:Kumorifox">Kumorifox</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kumorifox" title="User talk:Kumorifox">talk</a>) 17:26, 20 November 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since a marriage license issued in one county is good anywhere in Kansas. Kansas should be moved back to the blue (with a footnote). Gay marriage is legal in Kansas, you will just need to drive a little farther to get a license. Do we really want to have Gay Marriage in the USA by County. Those 19 counties that are issuing licenses add upt to 64% of Kansas population.</p>
