I thought that you had added a comment in the middle of an IP's entry from 6 months ago but I was wrong. You made two entries today above the IP's entry. It's not a good idea (particularly if you don't date your post) since it makes it look like the post from 6 months ago is a response to your new post, but nowhere near as serious as I thought. You say that you also made the orignal IP entry. I have no reason not to believe you, but there is no way I or anyone else could have known that.

<p>Hi, thanks for the note! Since the vandal seems to be hopping IPs, I think it may be more efficacious to simply semiprotect the page. I have done so for one month.

<dd>I suspect it will be required eventually. Someone took the trouble to write a polite, lengthy explanation of why the material should be included, and the IP's response was "Oh Blah Blah i don't care." followed by another blanking, a 3 week block (I might have the order wrong), and then continued blanking with a block evasion. It doesn't bode well for future good behaviour. I thought the block evasion warranted an automatic extension of the original block and a block on the new IP, but since it seems to be just this one article the semi-protection should work. Semi-protecting the article to stop one person on (so far) only 2 IPs seems disruptive to other IPs. I bow to your experience... do what you think best and I'l keep an eye on the Ips and the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 21:49, 24 March 2012 (UTC)

<p>I should not have told you or any editors that you were falsely accusing me, by saying that I promoted my theory. Surely it was "self-promotion," even/especially when I made a point of the weakness of other theories, which was an unecessary move. I clearly ought to have remained on the same IP address when editing, especially since I read about sockpuppetry beforehand.</p>
<p>Other editors said at the close of this discussion (which I perhaps should not have deleted) that I am an "unimportant philosopher." A rational response to such an assertion is not to take it personally. By the epithet, they don't mean that I don't have a strong humor theory. That would beg the question. They mean I haven't published a large number of other philosophy articles. I should not contest their view anymore, since I might always be referenced (or return myself) soon when my article is published. I don't deny that I am an academic philosopher, though I would be better classed as a psychologist and literary theorist.</p>
<p>I tried at an inappopriate time to contribute a drastic improvement on the existing and unsuccessful theories of humor. This has been removed on grounds which are reasonable though not perfect. And I should have accepted the decision sooner.</p>
<p>However, WP does overlook the fact that my work in humor has been conducted in two graduate programs, and in each one the work earned an MA degree. (This explains why I studied at U. of C. and am now at Loyola. Sorry for any confusion). Thus, it is unusual that I have earned two master's degrees, both in philosophy, and both on comedy or humor. The theses for those degrees are not the paper you have seen. The latter of these MAs requires two more grades, but this is only matter of a few weeks.</p>
<p>Thus the paper that you are talking about is actually not a "master's thesis." It contains a theory that I have mentioned before, but in a very different paper. This is an entirely separate article. The two "master's theses" had a different focus, and I have moved some way beyond them.</p>
<p>Ted Cohen, for example, directed my work in humor in 2006. He is a very "important philosopher" by the standards of Wikipedia, and my lack of esteem for him is irrelevant. I myself persuaded Ted Cohen, in conversation, that a theory of humor may be possible, which he has always denied in print. Another questionable feature of the Wikipedia policy guidelines is, if I may paraphrase in quotes, "If an idea is so important that it deserves immediate attention, someone would have reported on it already." I think this is awkwardly put. It is like saying, "If it so happens that an idea has been overlooked, and is quite important, then we can consider an author not published in the field." But that does not seem observed. It could read, "no matter the significance of a truth, its mention in WP requires directly relevent prior publication or a Phd degree." That seems to be the actual view. In my discussion of humor in wikipedia, I think I've made a strong case that nothing in the current theories in the article is at all persuasive as a global theory of stimulus and response, or represents a strong point of view of that much desired explanation.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Cdg1072&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cdg1072 (page does not exist)">Cdg1072</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cdg1072" title="User talk:Cdg1072">talk</a>) 18:31, 6 April 2012 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't mean to accuse you of intentionally using multiple IPs to maliciously make edits, but your use of possibly as many as 6 different IPs in addition to your account was very confusing, particularly when you edited Talk page discussions that you made with a different IP or account. Talk page discussions should never be edited since others may have already commented or made decisions based on the existing text. If you want to change or delete something you've said make a new entry or strikeout the original text, don't delete or modify it. And don't ever delete other editor's Talk page entries. I have restored the article Talk page, so you may want to go back and strikeout or make new entries on your sections that you deleted. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 18:54, 6 April 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please don't issue an only warning for simple vandalism, like you did for <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:205.133.153.198&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:205.133.153.198 (page does not exist)">User:205.133.153.198</a>. Admins should not block after just 2 piece of vandalism from an IP, and starting with an only warning makes it impossible for other users to escalate the warning.

<dd>Thanks, but did you look at the edit history? It wasn't simple vandalism, or a single vandalism. It was 7 clearly connected vandalisms by that IP and a second one from the same range, all in a matter of minutes. Once one IP got a final warning (from another editor) it switched back to the first IP, so I gave that one a final warning too. I did mention in the warning that the vandalism was hopping IPs. The next IP to vandalise got blocked, and then the other one also stopped. What would you suggest I have done differently? The edit you reverted was made just minutes after I gave him a final warning, and by the time you reverted him hours later he had long since made another vandalism edit, so in my opinion you should have had him blocked rather than bumping him down to a level 2 warning. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 03:59, 12 April 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And that was totally my fault--sorry about that. I didn't look at the history of the article you were reverting. I looked at the IP's contribution history, and saw only 2 pieces of vandalism, and thought you'd jumped the gun; but I didn't to check if there was IP hopping. My humblest apologies--immediately issuing and "only" or "level 4" warning on an ip hopper is totally fine.

<dd>Adding 10 references to support one entry on a list of alumni looks pretty lame. If you don't cut it back someone else will. I've already told you that the references from his own website, IMDb, and YouTube are not reliable sources, and some of the other ones seem pretty dubious too. I still don't see any ref to support the use of puffery such as "internet icon", and I still don't see any ref to prove that he attended the school. I won't touch it for now, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone else yanks it before I get back to it.

<dd>Thanks. He does seem to get around. The articles for creation seem to be a loophole. If they don't meet criteria for a speedy on Gx basis they seem to be able to hang around forever since they appear not to be eligible for speedy Ax (not actually an article). <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 18:38, 22 September 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He returned again, surely this is some kind of record? I think we should start a list of everywhere it has popped up. These are all the ones I know...</p>

<dd>I didn't put the speedy deletion tag on it. You would have to ask the editor who did. I'm just reverting your deletion of the tag. As the article creator you are not allowed to delete that. An admin will drop by and evaluate the article and your request to keep it. If you want to keep it you had better find some independant, reliable sources.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Infamous_Naked_Mile">The Infamous Naked Mile</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I went to original and reliable sources on my edit. Was there a problem? Thanks! PS I'm a UMich alum and current AA resident, so I know this event well. Also know who has the deepest repository of Naked Mile data.</p>
<dl>
<dd>reply to 99.185.56.156</dd>
<dd>It's interesting info, but there are a few problems:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't belong in the lead since the article is actually about the movie, not the original run. I suggest moving your material and references to a new section and just leaving a note in the lead that the movie was based on the original run.</li>
<li>The 2 references to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nakedmile.com/">the run's home page</a> have to go. The home page doesn't support anything and just serves as a blatant promotion for DVD sales.</li>
<li>The ref to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nakedmile.com/history.html">the history page</a> is a problem. I was going to say that it can't serve as a reference simce it's your webpage and contains first-hand input (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" title="Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect">WP:NOR</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PRIMARY" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect">WP:PRIMARY</a>) but you may be able to make a case for using it as a self-published source about itself (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ABOUTSELF" title="Wikipedia:ABOUTSELF" class="mw-redirect">WP:ABOUTSELF</a>).</li>
<li>What you really need is an independant, reliable source that says that the movie's run was based on the UMich run.</li>

You might want to ask <a href="/wiki/User:PKT" title="User:PKT">User:PKT</a> since he and I edit conflicted on adding the Speedy G4 template. It was a bad translation (significantly inproved today) of a French page I found on the web and there were other obvious problems, but I put it up for G4 rather than a proposed deletion since I thought that it had just been deleted the first time on July 28. It didn't seem likely that the article had changed significantly in one day when it had not in the more than one week it was up for deletion. Clearly I was badly mistaken on the date, and I wouldn't and shouldn't have G4ed it. The <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Boruch_Szlezinger_(2nd_nomination)" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boruch Szlezinger (2nd nomination)">current AFD</a> seems to be supporting a G4 speedy, so it looks like no harm was done.

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A work of the United States government, as defined by United States copyright law, is "a work prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government as part of that person's official duties."[1] The term only applies to the work of the federal government, including the governments of "non-organized territorial areas" under the jurisdiction of the U.S Government,[2] but not state or local governments. In general, under section 105 of the Copyright Act,[3] such works are not entitled to domestic copyright protection under U.S. law, sometimes referred to as "noncopyright." The act only applies to U.S. domestic copyright as that is the extent of U.S. federal law. The U.S. government asserts that it can still hold the copyright to those works in other countries.[4][5] In addition, many publications of the U.S. government contain protectable works authored by others (e.g., patent applications, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, public comments on regulations), and this rule does not necessarily apply to the creative content of those works.

<dd>Thanks for the headsup. It makes sense, but not all admins agree with your interpretation. There is nothing in the Speedy criteria (or even in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion/Explanations" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Explanations">Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Explanations</a>) that says that a draft that has been submitted for review cannot be speedied under an Article category. It seems like an obvious enough concern that it should have come up before, but I can't find it in a cursory search. I'll raise the question at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 17:50, 20 September 2012 (UTC)

<dd>I suppose the standard process if the submission is 'abandoned', and not suitable for creation, is to decline it. Blps without sources can also be blanked using {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Afc_cleared" title="Template:Afc cleared">afc cleared</a>}}. I think you're quite correct in realizing that there is a widespread lack of understanding about AFCs; In fact I recently tagged some AFCs for deletion as G12 candidates, that were subsequently deleted under G8 (which certainly can't be right). <a href="/wiki/User:France3470" title="User:France3470"><font face="Georgia"><b>France</b><font color="#1B3F8B"><i>3470</i></font></font></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:France3470" title="User talk:France3470">(<font size="2"><i>talk</i></font>)</a> 19:15, 20 September 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Meters. You reverted the change in <a href="/wiki/World_of_Ptavvs" title="World of Ptavvs">World of Ptavvs</a> articles, saying: "...giving a section a title such as "Plot" or "Ending" is considered sufficient warning to the reader that the text will contain revelations about the narrative..." That is absolutely correct and I agree with you. However, the spoiler in question was not in the Plot section of the page, but in the Reception section! People often check out the reception before deciding on whether to embark on reading a novel, especially if it is long. So don't you think that any spoilers would best be revealed in the plot section and not in critical reception? <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:EUflinks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EUflinks (page does not exist)">EUflinks</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:EUflinks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:EUflinks (page does not exist)">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/EUflinks" title="Special:Contributions/EUflinks">contribs</a>) 05:14, 13 February 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>

<dd>As I said in my edit summary, an AfD is not the same as a speedy. The speedy delete was declined because the article makes a <b>claim</b> of notability. That's enough to decline a speedy request and is why your article survived the speedy. It does not mean that your article is "good to go". Even if the claim of notability is not realistic (and I'm not saying that your article's claim is not reealistic) the speedy can be declined. To survive an AfD on notability grounds the topic of the article has to meet the much higher standard of actually <b>being</b> notable per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">wp:notability</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 18:47, 9 March 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just keep it where the talk atarts. As for your edits to <a href="/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics" title="Introduction to quantum mechanics">Introduction to quantum mechanics</a>, you comnpletely rewrote the article, shrinking it by more than 60k. That's a massive change, and the lack of response to your posting 10 months ago is not a sign that everyone will agree with the changes. You made the change to teh article and someone immediately reverted it. That means that the change should be discussed. See <a href="/wiki/BRD" title="BRD" class="mw-disambig">BRD</a>. So, I put the article back to the way it was before your changes. I would suggest that you raise the whole issue again on the article's talk page, but as a new thread rather than as the addendum you have now added to the old thread. The idea of completely rewriting the article, as you have, needs to be discussed in general rather than just asking people to pass on your new version. I suggest first seeing if you can get agreement that the article is at too high a level. If people agree then you can work on individual sections. I agree taht soem sections seem to be at too higha level for a layman's intro, bu tI think you'll have much more success if you don't try to rewrite the whole article at once. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 22:08, 20 March 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to start with don't delete large chunks of referenced text without an explanation. And why do you say the information is false? The information I checked (not everything) seems to be verified by the cited refs.</dd>
<dd>And finally, you should be very careful about editing this article as an employee of his publicist. That's a conflict of interest. You should read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COI" title="Wikipedia:COI" class="mw-redirect">WP:COI</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PUBLICISTS" title="Wikipedia:PUBLICISTS" class="mw-redirect">WP:PUBLICISTS</a>.

<p>Meters, again as I said I am new to Wikipedia and I appreciate the information on how to go about doing this correctly. Although I work for a publicist I am in no way trying to portray Carol in the "best possible light," but only the actual facts of his career. For starters this paragraph is at the beginning of his discography section ahead of his albums. Wouldn't it make more sense to go in a career section? And it's not so much the information that is false it's the way in which it is portrayed. This was brought to my attention yesterday by Carol's son who called me and asked me to find out about it because it was a song that he had never heard of &amp; wanted some info on it. After doing some research I found that the song is not on sale anywhere &amp; other than the articles that are referenced I'm still not for certain that all of the artists listed as singing on the song actually did. However, I am researching that currently. The whole thing is just very strange because this is hardly the biggest accomplishment of someone who is 7 Dove Awards &amp; 2 Grammys and yet it's got an entire paragraph at the top of his discography. It would be one thing if it was listed as a small blurb in the career section but even that is stretching it a bit. The falsehood is the way in which the song is portrayed as if it was a huge hit. And yes it was nominated for an Emmy but it was a local enemy, which does not carry much prestige. All that to say no one is trying to hype his career up. if anything I'm trying to downplay what should be BUT that's neither here not there. My only concern is Mr. Carroll's page. "Hands of Hope" was not an officially downplayed. In response to Canyouhearmenow's "I don't know what they're up to" comment, they are up to displaying the facts in the most factual way possible. After reading some of your contributions, I'm not certain you're capable of that.released single under any legitimate label &amp; therefore doesn't belong at the bottom of the discography either. So, Meters please tell me how I can go about correcting this. I am posting this here, because I've had no reply to the one I posted in a different area, because I'm not really sure how this all works lol. I guess since my original post canyouhearmenow has taken down two of their responses. Anyways like I said, the song was never actually released as a single. AND there is nothing ANYWHERE on a website with any validity that states the supposed artists in which it lists that did. Not saying it didn't happen, but it does make one wonder. So I ask again, how does this get either removed or placed in a better spot &amp; severely edited?l<small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:Art4artssakeent" title="User:Art4artssakeent">Art4artssakeent</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Art4artssakeent" title="User talk:Art4artssakeent">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Art4artssakeent" title="Special:Contributions/Art4artssakeent">contribs</a>) 08:05, 22 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>

<dd>Art4artssakeent: I am unsure as to what you are talking about in reference to taking anything down? The only thing I did was take out some of the fluff in the article and re-cite some dead links. As far as the Discography section of Carroll's page, all articles have to start somewhere. It in no way means that this was Carroll's biggest contribution and I have not read anywhere that they were trying to make it into a huge deal. In fact I don't find anywhere that this song is available for commercial release? So, as far as playing down the event or piece I would suggest going in and adding more of Carroll's career highlights under his discography section in an effort to build the section. Anything that you put in that section at this point is going to look awkward due to lack of content. However, in situations like this as stated before it is not recommended for agents and publicists to edit said articles due to their writing content like a press release instead of an encyclopedic article. I would highly recommend that you read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COI" title="Wikipedia:COI" class="mw-redirect">WP:COI</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PUBLICISTS" title="Wikipedia:PUBLICISTS" class="mw-redirect">WP:PUBLICISTS</a> in an effort to educate yourself to the proper editing. I edit a lot of articles in which subjects do not wish to have things added. If the material is capable of being verified then it can be added. I am the editor that added this material to start with and I did so after reading about the event where the song was performed by the artists mentioned as well as two of the writers. So, I am confused as to how that is capable of making one wonder? Just because a piece of work is not generated or sold does not make it none the less valid. Car makers design prototype vehicles that never hit the road but that does not mean they were never built. I also edit the Emmy articles and created many of those articles over the years. The fact of the piece being nominated on a regional level verses a national level does not negate the fact that the song was indeed nominated for an Emmy. An Emmy is an Emmy is an Emmy. This should also serve as a confirmation to you that there might not have been an over-hyping of the work since it was released only to a regional area. I think we may be getting a bit over worked over a situation that simply can be solved by added more of Carroll's career highlights that would in turn put this one in its proper context.<a href="/wiki/User:Canyouhearmenow" title="User:Canyouhearmenow">Canyouhearmenow</a> 17:40, 22 May 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Art4artssakeent, you work for the artist's publicist, and you removed a large chunk of the article without explanation twice. Then you complained that the information you had removed was false. After two editors double checked the information and confirmed that it was not false, you backtracked. And then you say "After reading some of your contributions, I'm not certain you're capable of that [displaying the facts in the most factual way possible]." Pardon me if my <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" title="Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect">assumption of good faith</a> in you has reached its limit. I see no reason for you to make a statement like that about me. I've politely pointed out what you did wrong and pointed you to the links that tell you how to deal with having a conflict of interest and working as a publicist. Will I help you add pertinent information that is referenced to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" title="Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect">reliable sources</a>? Yes. Will I help you remove information that should not be in the article? Yes. Will I help you massage the article into what the artist's publicist (your company) or the artist or the artist's son want to see? No. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 22:41, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

<dd>Meters, that comment was in no way directed at you. It was directed to canyouhearmenow. I apologize that it read that way. That was in no way my intent. I was asking you for help. This ENTIRE comment below is actually in direct response to canyouhearmenow, so please do not take it as being toward you.</dd>
<dd>Ok just so we can be clear on a couple of things... I am not a publicist, nor do I work at a publicity firm. I am a retired officer turned retired owner of a security company turned freelance investigator. Lots of turns. Lol. Anyways, I don't need to get too personal. I am old school as they say and not very tech savvy &amp; a publicist who hires me occasionally to do some investigating asked that I look into this. I guess this edit was removed &amp; put up again a few times by the person who is in charge of running Mr. Carroll's internet profiles. It actually would've been ignored, but Mr. Carroll's son is planning something for his father &amp; came across this song that he didn't know existed &amp; called the publicist to find out about it. That's where I come in. I don't think it's being overblown at all. I have actually found a treasure trove of fascinating information &amp; have learned the ins &amp; outs of how Wikipedia works.</dd>
<dd>Moving on. I couldn't understand how some things on Wikipedia could be so easily edited while others were edited then replaced with the material edited out within a matter of minutes sometimes seconds. I'm still not exactly sure how all that works other than the fact that there are certain people that have certain things on watch lists. Now, why would anyone want Bruce Carroll's page on a watch list? There's only one reason… they have a personal agenda. Having been around The Nashville music scene especially the Christian music scene since the late 70s I pretty much know everyone there is to know in this small little circle. The only reason to I say that is because after reading the article &amp; seeing this strange paragraph sticking out, I knew exactly who Bruce Carroll and David Meece were, but I had never heard of a David L. Cook. I didn't really think anything of it until I went to his Wikipedia page. Wow. <span class="history-deleted">(Redacted)</span>. And after seeing how much you've edited of everything that he's affiliated with I find it hard to believe that you posted that because you came across an article and then some Emmy nods. That is a whole different matter of its own, however I am going to get to the bottom of it. It's really crazy to think we live in a world where anyone can be what they want to be on the Internet. But this man has gone above and beyond… No pun intended. Lol. Anyways, I'm going to look into getting this current matter at hand resolved &amp; removed. So thanks for the enlightenment? I don't really know what else to say. ~~Art4artssake~~ <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:Art4artssakeent" title="User:Art4artssakeent">Art4artssakeent</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Art4artssakeent" title="User talk:Art4artssakeent">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Art4artssakeent" title="Special:Contributions/Art4artssakeent">contribs</a>) 01:03, 23 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small>

<p>Meters - please don't <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE" title="Wikipedia:BITE" class="mw-redirect">bite</a> the newcomers. Your reverting Moira's edits was utterly unhelpful - you could have gone through and put in proper indenting for her at the very least. I've restored her edits with formatting, but it's now over a month later, and Ms. Greyland hasn't come back to Wikipedia at all. <span style="font-family:serif;font-size:120%"><b><a href="/wiki/User:Argyriou" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Argyriou" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></span> 17:30, 11 June 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the note, but I stand behind what I did. I undid a probable BLP violation with numerous violations of the talk page standards (no less than seven unsigned and unindented comments inserted into the middle of other peoples long-dormant threads and comments. I left a polite summary <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Marion_Zimmer_Bradley&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=607387330">here</a> saying "please add these again but without disrupting the original discussions" and then I immediately left a polite, detailed message on her Talk page <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moiragreyland&amp;oldid=607391424">here</a> explaining exactly what was wrong with her additions, why it was a problem, why I had removed her comments rather than modifying them myself, and how to recover the comments without having to retype them. I also provided her with the link to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TPHELP" title="Wikipedia:TPHELP" class="mw-redirect">WP:TPHELP</a>. I don't consider that <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE" title="Wikipedia:BITE" class="mw-redirect">biting</a> a newcomer at all. I don't think I could have been any more polite or helpful. As for your suggestion that I should have taken it upon myself to refactor all of her comments myself, well, I might have, had the material been less of a BLP nightmare. I wasn't going to touch that mess of a discussion of lesbianism, paganism, molestation, and pedophilia to do with Marion Zimmer Bradley and her husband. I (and you) had no way of knowing if the editor really was their daughter, as she claimed. You, on the other hand, took the responsibility for restoring the edit. You don't get a bye on a BLP (or any other) violation just because you're restoring someone else's edit. And just adding indents and signatures is not enough to clarify edits that have been inserted into the middle of someone else's comment, as some of them were. A few rounds of that and no-one will know who wrote what.</dd>
<dd>By the way, if you are going to refer to something that happened a month ago it would be nice if you left a link to the edit, or at least to the article in question. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 21:30, 11 June 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't assume that large deletions were vandalism. Unlike you, I read the school webpage and the school profile to see what could be verified, and left edit summaries to explain what I was doing. Also unlike you, I provided sources. I also read the page history to see what was going on. By reverting a deletion <b>you</b> become responsible for that content. Repeatedly inserting nonexistent sports like Bad<a href="/wiki/Mitten" title="Mitten" class="mw-redirect">mitten</a>, courses that the school does not offer such as Soviet History, and other unsourced material is a problem, and you can't blame it on whoever first put it in. If you can't be bothered to check that the info you are putting back is valid, then don't do it. I've been removing this crap from that article for months, and I'm fed up. As I said above, "If you keep inserting the same highly suspicious material without edit summaries, and tagged as minor edits, don't be surprised if I assume it's you again when an IP pops up after you are warned to make the same edit." If you can provide reliable sources for this material I will happily remove the warning. I don't think you can, because the school's website and school profile are quite informative, and they make no mention of these courses, and sports. I couldn't find a source that listed the school's clubs, but I really doubt that there is a Commissar Club or a Ukrainians for Soviet Russia Club. I could be wrong, but your edit replacing the Christians for Rock over Classical Club with the Commissar's Club just seems too much. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 21:57, 27 June 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Meters,</p>
<p>I received both of your messages today both regarding changing my user name (which I have requested) as well as having multiple accounts for editing. In fact I only have one account (this one) and have been forced to keep creating new ones since, as you said, I was blocked before.</p>
<p>As you can tell from the history log, I have been contributing minor edits to this page since March 2013. This page rarely changed until it came under attack by a competitor in April 2014. His first change was under the user name IP 50.125.49.35 which he later changed to IP 50.125.50.208 and finally Bruceki. At the same time he recruited others to slander the Nature's Harmony Farm name both on Wikipedia as well as numerous Facebook pages and blogs. Most of those sites recognized the subjective and personal nature of his non-factual attacks and banned him from contributing. In the past month, I have simply been trying to remove his slander from this site. Nearly all of the changes that he suggests to the Nature's Harmony Farm page are non-factual, strongly biased and link to HIS personal blog.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I can do to help. <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Naturesharmony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Naturesharmony (page does not exist)">Naturesharmony</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Naturesharmony" title="User talk:Naturesharmony">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Naturesharmony" title="Special:Contributions/Naturesharmony">contribs</a>) 19:33, 7 July 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I also have concerns with some of the original content in the article. That's why I just tagged the article with COI but have not reverted your change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with your account is that you did not discuss the issues with the article with the editor reverting you, despite numerous attempts to get you to do so. You were blocked for a short period (I don't remember the exact reason given, but you certainly violated <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" title="Wikipedia:3RR" class="mw-redirect">wp:3RR</a>) and your unblock request was denied because of your <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COI" title="Wikipedia:COI" class="mw-redirect">WP:COI</a> and refusal to discuss the edits. Rather than waiting for the short block to expire you then created a new account and made the same edit. This account was blocked for socking and the block on your original account was extended to an indefinite one for <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Block_evasion" title="Wikipedia:Block evasion" class="mw-redirect">WP:block evasion</a>. You then created this account, and made the edit again. And now that there's a sock puppet investigation, you attempted to change your name. It's completely untrue for you to say that you only have one account, <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Naturesharmony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Naturesharmony (page does not exist)">user:Naturesharmony</a>, since it wasn't even created until after your other two accounts were indefinitely blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Blocks apply to the person behind the account. You should not be editing Wikipedia at all, under any name or IP (and I will not respond to any more edits to my talk page by you). The only thing you can do now is to go back to your original account and make a convincing unblock request using that account. Read <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_appealing_blocks" title="Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks">Wikipedia:Guide to appealing blocks</a>. If you don't convince the admins that you understand what you did wrong and that you will not do it again I doubt very much that you have any chance at all. And if you make any more edits to anything else (no matter how correct or well-intentioned) before this is resolved, it will just be more evidence that you should not be unblocked. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 20:07, 7 July 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is not entirely accurate. It is true that my original login said I would be blocked for a short period, 48 hours. However, when attempting to login to that account today a message appeared that it was banned INDEFINITELY. Therefore, there was no option for me to respond. I didn't respond to the original talk requests because I knew it was SPAM. Since one of Wikipedia's goals, I assume, is true and accurate reporting, I thought the editors would see through that attack. Clearly I was mistaken but I would hope we could focus on ensuring accurate content. <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Naturesharmony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Naturesharmony (page does not exist)">Naturesharmony</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Naturesharmony" title="User talk:Naturesharmony">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Naturesharmony" title="Special:Contributions/Naturesharmony">contribs</a>) 20:18, 7 July 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>

<p>The talk page for this article has a list of the items that this person appears to object to. They're numbered. He has yet to respond to any request for discussion on this article, instead making the blanket claim that everything is slander and untrue. One item that is clearly and objectively true is that the farm is for sale, for instance. Objecting to an articles contents or veracity is fine -- but the place to do that is the talk page, not via vandalism. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Bruceki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bruceki (page does not exist)">Bruceki</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Bruceki" title="User talk:Bruceki">talk</a>) 07:59, 8 July 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm watching the article. I have not made any changes other than adding the COI template so far, but I will.

His latest account is not blocked yet, but he has stopped editing since I explained things to him, so I suspect that he just didn't understand what he was doing wrong. That doesn't mean that you have free rein to put whatever you want into the article. Some of what you are adding is not acceptable. A user submitted Amazon.com review is certainly not a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_source" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source" class="mw-redirect">WP:Reliable source</a> to quote in the article, for example.

<p>Hello meters I'm NISSAN GTR 1088 I apologize for messing up Wikipedia, and I'm not trying to cover my butt. I want you to know that I am not using multiple accounts and infact a Wikipedia account owner with his account named calgary rocks is my friend. When he changes the crime rate in china to 0.8 and stuff like that it's actually the real crime rate. I changed it to way higher numbers as a joke. I could really do without your kind of snotty messages on my <a href="/wiki/Talk_page" title="Talk page" class="mw-redirect">talk page</a>. This is not ment to be as snotty as you are probably interpreting it to be. part of the reason I messed things up was because as I said earlier calgary rocks would make China's homicide rate 0.8 and you would change it to a fake number. I'm not sure if your doing it on purpose cause you are unfair and jealous of China, or if you are doing it by accident. Let me know on my talk page which I have left 2 links for. I have been looking back a recent things people have left for you on your talk page and I get the feeling you have a bad history on Wikipedia. If you want you can leave me a message on my <a href="/wiki/Talk_page" title="Talk page" class="mw-redirect">talk page</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I didn't leave snotty remarks. I left polite, standard warning templates. If you don't like them I suggest you stop making disruptive edits. I changed the numbers in <a href="/wiki/Crime_in_China" title="Crime in China">Crime in China</a> back to the original values as given in the cited source. As I said on your talk page "You can't change the numbers but still claim to use the same source. Provide a new source if the numbers are real." You admit above that you are adding false information (that's vandalism), and that you are doing it in tandem with the other account. When there is a pattern of one of you makes a vandalism edit and the other coming along a few seconds later and to cover the vandalism up by making a dummy edit (such as adding a period or a space) it appears that you are either operating the second account as a sockpuppet (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CHRONOSOCK" title="Wikipedia:CHRONOSOCK" class="mw-redirect">WP:CHRONOSOCK</a>), or that the other account is a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MEAT" title="Wikipedia:MEAT" class="mw-redirect">meatpuppet</a> colluding with you to disrupt the articles. Either way, I stand by the warnings I have left on both accounts. If the edits continue the next step will be either a request for blocks at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ANI" title="Wikipedia:ANI" class="mw-redirect">WP:ANI</a> or a sockpupet investigation at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SPI" title="Wikipedia:SPI" class="mw-redirect">WP:SPI</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 18:01, 16 July 2014 (UTC)</dd>

And I've been threatened with further blocks for naming other editors in the course of explaining the history of changed titles and the jiggery-pokery that mandated them. I've given up, it's pointless to argue reality with those who live only in the rarefied world of wikipedia guidelines). I'm only logged in briefly, as I will continue to monitor my talkpage for unwelcome trolling or hectoring/lecturing; I've tolerated way too much quasi-official garbage as it is. I'm an old man, and don't need the strain, and don't need to spend more of my good energy and good faith on people determined to be critical and contrarian; the massive disrespect towards regular editors of all kinds, some still around by many left, is one reason I see no further reason to give any contributions to Wikipedia; Wikimedia Commons I have avoided for a while because of even higher-handed arbitrariness, but the 'monkey business' means that no WAY will I ever contribute more photos, or money, to WikiMedia because of its highly offensive and questionable spending of money on that very, very, very improper and controversial legal case.

<p>Hi. The original edit, with the only possible citation for a group with no notability was to counter unsubstantiated claims of up to 5000 members. It was carefully worded to state that there were 3 <b>known</b> members, which is the only verifiable information about this group's membership. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:AntiCauliflower92&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:AntiCauliflower92 (page does not exist)">AntiCauliflower92</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:AntiCauliflower92" title="User talk:AntiCauliflower92">talk</a>) 20:03, 26 August 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p>Removal of Archbishop Wood HS Alumni Gay Hate Crime Article</p>
<p>I do not know if you are the Wikipedia Administrator who had this article removed twice, but the Wikipedia administrators have collectively been censoring this topic.</p>
<p>The topic and the conclusion it was a hate crime has not only been reported in "fringe" papers (which I guess is code for "gay" by the Wikipedia administrators) but by mainstream papers and television stations (NBC, ABC, Fox) in Philadelphia The Archdiocese of Philadelphia shares this viewpoint as evidenced by its comments on the crime.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should contain articles on hate crimes, which reflect on both American society and human nature.</p>
<p>I would be fine with edits and improvements to this article, but am very disappointed with the Wikipedia censorship machine that removed the article in its entirety twice.

<p>1st Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Recce platoon is in fact a recon unit in Canada and it's hardest member is in fact cpl Martin. I know him well. I'm was in the platoon. He still is. Cpl Martin is a legend in 1ppcli. We say to recruits on the recce course Matt Martin was never born he was forged on mount Olympus to inspire them to be like him. By deleting this you are removing apart of canadian military culture that should be known and people can be proud of. Canada should look at it's soldiers and know small things like this. Its human interest and it gives personality to canadas fighting men. Also you missed 1,2 and 3 rcr recon platoons and 3 PPCLI recon platoon. Those platoons all saw heavy fighting in Afghanistan and should have a mention on this page.</p>
<p>P.s the PPCLI pages is rife with errors. Our moto isn't "once a Patricia" we have several but that not one of them and we don't call the LER 4 PPCLI. None of us do. They call themselves that and it's insulting to us because they aren't Patricia's and nothing like us. The PPCLI battle school is one of the hardest infantry courses in the world and they weren't on one ever. My grandma might aswell say she's a U.S. Marine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Super_Yacht_Fan">Super Yacht Fan</span></h2>
<p>Dear Meters,</p>
<p>Can you please reconsider your correction? I think you are overreaction regarding my 'spamming'. If I would be spamming, I would place dozens of links all over Wikipedia. But actually there are just 3 or 4 links from Wikipedia to my site, of which 1 or 2 were put online by myself. Apparently the competent moderator did not consider the info as spam. In this case it was not spam.. It is widely known that Bram van Leeuwen lived on his yacht <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et9mZ387kgY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et9mZ387kgY</a> Also it is a fact that his partner sold the yacht after he died <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.superyachttimes.com/editorial/3/article/id/8815">http://www.superyachttimes.com/editorial/3/article/id/8815</a> And even Wikipedia mentions that Craig McCaw bought her <a class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feadship">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feadship</a> So if I would be searching Bram van Leeuwen on Wikipedia, than I would consider this relevant, or at least interesting. The fact that my site has a general disclaimer does not mean that all data is incorrect. Wikipedia is referring to more sites with disclaimers.... So please reconsider.. I am no spammer.

<dd>There's no need for you to avoid editing articles and adding properly sourced material. There is no issue of conflict of interest or advertising if you avoid citing your own website. Any material you add does have to verifiable from reliable sources though. Between this page, your talk page, and <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Edgar181" title="User talk:Edgar181">User talk:Edgar181</a> you have been pointed to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" title="Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect">WP:RS</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ADV" title="Wikipedia:ADV" class="mw-redirect">WP:ADV</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COI" title="Wikipedia:COI" class="mw-redirect">WP:COI</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EL" title="Wikipedia:EL" class="mw-redirect">WP:EL</a>. That should cover what you need to know. It's also been suggested that you can take the issue to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RSN" title="Wikipedia:RSN" class="mw-redirect">WP:RSN</a> if you still think your webpage should be an acceptable source. I think it would be a waste of time, but it's available if you want a third opinion or don't understand why we have rejected your website.</dd>
<dd>The sources you mention above are less than compelling. The Youtube link might be acceptable if it were an official page of someone considered to be an authority on the subject (the owner, for example) but it does no appear to be such. www.superyachttimes.com may well be acceptable, but I'm not able to tell since I don't know how well they research their facts. That one would likely have go to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RSN" title="Wikipedia:RSN" class="mw-redirect">WP:RSN</a>. The wikiarticle cannot be used for a source, but it does appear to source the statement. If so that source can be reused.</dd>
<dd>Regardless of how good any sources are, I agree with <a href="/wiki/User:Edgar181" title="User:Edgar181">User:Edgar181</a> that the specific edit you made to <a href="/wiki/Bram_van_Leeuwen" title="Bram van Leeuwen">Bram van Leeuwen</a> is not appropriate to the article.

<dd>I didn't call that sandbox edit vandalism. It's mildly offensive and might fall under the category of offensive material which the header asks editors not to make, but so what. It will be blanked automatically. It's not at all the same thing as a sock of a blocked editor putting 1.4 M of useless crap (now less) in his sandbox. You didn't answer my question of whether this would have been better requested under G1 or U5 instead, so I assume that you would also not have accepted either of those. It seems very odd to have to bother filing a sock report on this user just to clean up his sandbox as block evasion. As for not harming anything, big useless files use resources, and at some size they can cause real harm. I've seen users create similarly useless Wikipedia files so big that creating diffs of them crashed the server. <a href="/wiki/User:Meters" title="User:Meters">Meters</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Meters#top" title="User talk:Meters">talk</a>) 04:04, 14 October 2014 (UTC)

<p>I provided sources where needed, and did not make any statements of fact that were either without sources, or that could not be substantiated by the sources already given; e.g, the already cited and linked OEC webpage displays the number of clerics in various regions I specified. The source given for the number of members, which I deleted in my edit along with the statement of number of members, is the OEC's own webpage which contains unsubstantiated evidence. This edit was reverted, which shows that others editing my own edits are not doing so in accord with the same standards they are allegedly imposing on me. In terms of neutrality, I deliberately made statements such as "what some clerics viewed as" to signal opinions rather than making statements of opinion as if they were facts. Anyway, I will desist from making edits as some of you editors are clearly satisfied with bias in one direction and are happy to enforce inconsistent standards and allow bad sourcing elsewhere.

After that length of time with no link and no source I don't see the need to ask for a citation.

I also removed at least one red-linked entry that had a source because the ref did not appear to me to be sufficient to show notability.

<p>Thank you so much for fixing my corrections. I am new to this and only have basic knowledge. I don't know if this is the correct way to use a talk page, but could you direct me on how to add photos? I am not knowledgeable enough to read the wikipedia helps, yet. I am also having trouble with categorizing this page, and adding links so that it is not an orphan article. Any direction would be appreciated. I have much more information to add here. <a href="/wiki/User:Beasmom" title="User:Beasmom">Beasmom</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Beasmom" title="User talk:Beasmom">talk</a>) 15:49, 20 November 2014 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Beasmom" title="User:Beasmom">Beasmom</a> You're very welcome. You're off to a good start. I'll take another pass through your latest additions and you can look at what I've done. Two quick hints:
<ul>
<li>When reusing the same ref there is no need to re-enter all the same info. Name the ref once and just call the name for subsequent uses of the ref. The article body looks the same on the displayed page but is much shorter and easier to read in edit mode, and the list of references is shorter. I'll put in a named ref for the Journal of Laboratory Physicians ref so you can see how to do it.</li>
<li>You should try to fill in the refs rather than just using bare URLS. If you click the "Cite" button while editing it will bring up a menu for adding cites to make it easier. See <a href="/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/3" title="Help:Introduction to referencing/3">Help:Introduction to referencing/3</a> for info on using this toolbar. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:REF" title="Wikipedia:REF" class="mw-redirect">WP:REF</a> for detailed referencing info. Don't worry if you can't figure it out right away. The bare URLs you have used are sufficient to allow more experienced editors to fill in the missing bits. The biggest concern is that it may be impossible to update or replace a dead link if it was just a bare URL.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>For uploading images, you should start with <a href="/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_uploading_images/1" title="Help:Introduction to uploading images/1">Help:Introduction to uploading images/1</a>. It's critical that any images you upload are meet the copyright requirements for free use on Wikipedia. If not they will quickly be deleted. Where did you get the images?</dd>
<dd>Don't worry about the categorization for now. That can be quite difficult to do, and there are knowledgeable editors who can do it. Similarly, don't worry about linking other articles to this one for now. Get this article into good shape and we can figure out what should link here later. I'll keep an eye on how it's doing.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spoilers_2">Spoilers</span></h2>
<p>While providing complete plot synopses would certainly be helpful to students of a genre, not to mention students using Wikipedia for book report material, there are times when a complete synopsis ruins the original experience for anyone at all interested in actually reading a book or seeing a movie. It is not tacitly understood that a silent spoiler alert precedes a plot synopsis. That's like arguing an intersection implies vehicles should stop before crossing, ergo obviating the need for stop signs. Sounds ridiculous put that way, yes? One should never make a blanket imputation of subtlety of thought to any human being. A simple solution would be to use the mechanism game wikis use of flagging plot synopses with a warning which anyone can override if they do need to read the synopsis, as for example reviewers or programmers. In the specific instance in question, I read the plot synopsis of the movie "The Spanish Prisoner" which relies almost entirely on the audience not knowing who is really who and what is really going on. That's the genius of the movie. Though not for anyone who read the synopsis before -- and probably then, instead of-- seeing the movie itself. <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:The_Theater_Cricket&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:The Theater Cricket (page does not exist)">The Theater Cricket</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:The_Theater_Cricket" title="User talk:The Theater Cricket">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/The_Theater_Cricket" title="Special:Contributions/The Theater Cricket">contribs</a>) 00:59, 1 December 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>

The "<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_disclaimers_in_articles" title="Wikipedia:No disclaimers in articles">No disclaimers in articles</a>" guideline details why spoiler warnings are no longer used on Wikipedia.

<p>I didn't look into it too much, but your recent interaction with Hullaballoo Wolfowitz is par for the course. He seems to go on binges where he makes changes to articles based on his opinion and/or personal interpretation of policy.

Granted, he does make some good edits especially on BLP articles, but in my opinion he creates more work for other Editors than any kind of positive net contribution. But that's based on my interaction with him. --<a href="/wiki/User:Scalhotrod" title="User:Scalhotrod">Scalhotrod</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Scalhotrod" title="User talk:Scalhotrod">(Talk)</a> ☮ღ☺ 15:46, 6 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry. I was trying to change some of the things in the existing article and since this was my first time, I pressed the move button. I also thought that the article was in my sandbox, and therefore I thought I could work on the other article there without it being public. <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Rmpatel9&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rmpatel9 (page does not exist)">Rmpatel9</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Rmpatel9" title="User talk:Rmpatel9">talk</a> • <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rmpatel9" title="Special:Contributions/Rmpatel9">contribs</a>) 02:15, 8 December 2014 (UTC)</span></small></p>

<dd>It's back in your userspace now, and the version in the incorrect namespace has been removed.. I figured you had done something you didn't mean to do. As I said on your talk page, you probably shouldn't make large scale changes to an article all in one edit in any case. It's better to break it into smaller chunks so other editors can evaluate the changes to each section separately. 04:21, 8 December 2014 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Meters</p>
<p>You're absolutely correct. The right-of-way would be the correct term. From a legal standpoint the railway owns the right-of-way land. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/132.156.224.223" title="Special:Contributions/132.156.224.223">132.156.224.223</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:132.156.224.223&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:132.156.224.223 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:02, 8 December 2014 (UTC) Kent</p>
