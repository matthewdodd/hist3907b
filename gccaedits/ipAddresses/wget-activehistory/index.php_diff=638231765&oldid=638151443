<p>I have recently been reading a revised book on psychotherapy. Prochaska, J.O., &amp; Norcross, J.C.(2010) <i>Systems of Psychotherapy: A Transtheoretical Analysis</i>. They place EMDR under <a href="/wiki/Exposure_therapy" title="Exposure therapy">Exposure Therapies</a> (along with implosive and prolonged therapy). I haven't searched around for other articles suggesting it is an exposure therapy, but perhaps if other evidence emerges we could cite EMDR as a form of exposure therapy. <a href="/wiki/User:CReep-cReep" title="User:CReep-cReep" class="mw-redirect">cReep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:CReep-cReep" title="User talk:CReep-cReep" class="mw-redirect">talk</a>) 11:10, 3 February 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
There is quite a bit of scientific evidence to suggest that the processes that occur in EMDR are different from the processes that occur in exposure therapy for the treatment of trauma.(see Rogers &amp; Silver, 2002). According to a strict exposure definition, there are 3 main differences between the processes in EMDR and exposure therapy that should result in EMDR being ineffective for treating PTSD as the procedure of EMDR should sensitize rather than desensitize the memories being processed.</p>
<p>First, EMDR is not based on habituation like exposure therapy as EMDR uses short 20- to 50-second, interrupted exposures rather than continuous 20- to 100-minute exposures, traditionally recommended for prolonged exposure. Second, EMDR is nondirective,allowing for free association. The client often moves quickly through events or skips scenes by spontaneously changing to other memories that come to mind. In EMDR, this is not considered to be avoidance but is instead viewed as effective memory processing (Lee &amp; Drummond, 2008; Lee, Taylor, &amp; Drummond, 2006). Third,in EMDR, reliving the traumatic memory in the present tense is not a requirement of effecitve therapy. Taking a third-party perspective on the trauma memory is also not seen as avoidance, and, unlike traditional exposure, reliving is not associated with improvement in EMDR (Lee &amp; Drummond, 2008).</p>
<p>Thus, according to the assumptions of emotional processing theory (Foa &amp; Rothbaum, 1998),which underlie exposure therapy for PTSD, EMDR is not working through the processes of traditional exposure as the type of exposure that occurs in EMDR should result in minimal decreased fear if exposure is the proposed mechanism of change. Yet EMDR is effective in treating adult PTSD and associated symptoms, thus other processes and underlying working mechanisms are at play. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Sschubert&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sschubert (page does not exist)">Sschubert</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sschubert" title="User talk:Sschubert">talk</a>) 04:22, 10 March 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excellent and accurate summary of how EMDR differs from <i>prolonged</i> exposure (PE) therapy. Yes, EMDR definitely involves exposure, that is, having the client vividly bring their traumatic event, events, triggers or future apprehensions to mind. Evidence so far indicates that this is a necessary step for <i>any</i> effective PTSD therapy aiming at remission rather than symptom reduction and management. The major difference is in the <i>prolonged</i> part. PE literally immerses the client in their traumatic memories for extended and intense periods -- that is mostly what it it about. EMDR does not have that intensive or prolonged aspect to exposure. Yet according to all recent meta-studies and endorsements, EMDR works just as well as PE, and there is now evidence that it works faster and better and especially better for depression associated with PTSD. To say that EMDR therefore works by a different mechanism than PE is hard to justify except as pure speculation. In fact, it is quite plausible, given current research, the PE works by the same mechanism as EMDR but simply not as well, hence it is generally slower and certainly requires more emotional pain and energy than EMDR. <a href="/wiki/User:Djlewis" title="User:Djlewis">djlewis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Djlewis" title="User talk:Djlewis">talk</a>) 02:13, 11 June 2014 (UTC)</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_anything_in_psychotherapy_definitively_explained.3F">Is <i>anything</i> in psychotherapy definitively explained?</span></h5>
<p>Is there any explanation why watching your breath go in and out and fondling a raisin (that is, MBSR) works for stress, anxiety and chronic pain? Seriously, the psychologists and neuroscientists are working on both MBSR and EMDR, but I assure you they are not at all close to a definitive explanation of either. In fact, some research has suggested the eye movements and attentional breathing are related!</p>
<p>Actually, it's even worse than that. I don't feel like digging up references right now, but many observers have noted that <i>no psychotherapy technique or system has an adequate explanation (in scientific terms) for why it works</i>, even those that are proven effective by high-quality scientific outcome studies. And the neuroscience of it all is still "pre-Newtonain", as at least two prominent neuroscientists have stated.</p>
<p>I know why people pick on EMDR. The standard account -- it's all eye movements -- makes it seem just too far out, and the initial claims -- which have proven to be true -- for really helping PTSD sounded too outrageous to be taken seriously. Also, the early studies were weak. But there's lots more to EMDR than eye movements, and they are arguably not even the "active ingredient" but more of a catalyst to make the actual active ingredient, client-centered free association primed by traumatic memory, work better and faster.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Profit_Bias_Rejoinder">Profit Bias Rejoinder</span></h2>
<p>This is an inaccurate allegation. The only basis I can see is that EMDR is indeed a trademark, and to call oneself an EMDR therapist requires certification. Certification entails a modest training program (days, not weeks, months or years), a period of supervised practice, continuing yearly membership and occasional CEUs. I know a number of EMDR therapists, and I can assure you that the charges for all these are well in keeping with usual charges for professional certification and specialization, and after the initial period, are insignificant for a professional. I also know some EMDR therapists who provide group supervision, and they all charge their regular hourly client rate divided by the number of participants.</p>
<p>Thus, if there are significant profits being by someone in the EMDR world, it isn't either off of or by the therapists. I also doubt if the national organization is making much money, as they carry out a significant and beneficial program of research, training and dissemination that is well worth the modest yearly dues.</p>
<p>We could certainly discuss whether it is appropriate for a proven, highly effective and beneficial psychotherapy system such as EMDR to be controlled by a private organization. But my take on that would be that there is a sordid history in the psychology profession of opening up such systems, particularly those with somewhat unconventional elements, to unrestrained claims by practitioners. On the other side, it has limited the number of practitioners somewhat, but it does give a higher level of confidence to a client that a practitioner is well-trained and acting in a professional manner. Also since there are now a number of effective therapies for PTSD other than EMDR, if someone wants to treat PTSD clients (which is really hard and demanding work, by the way) but doesn't want to undertake EMDR certification for financial or any reason, there are plenty of options. But I bet most CB/PE therapists, for example, also undertook a good deal of training and belong to a specialty organization, in addition to their own licensing body such as the APA.</p>
<p>So, unless you have some documented proof that someone is making significant profits off of EMDR, I seriously question this allegation, and it certainly does not belong in the article.</p>

<p>"if there are significant profits being by someone in the EMDR world, it isn't either <b>off of</b> or by the therapists" -- It means that nobody (such as EMDRIA) is making significant profits by selling services to EMDR therapists, and the therapists themselves are not making any more profit than other similarly qualified psychotherapists. Of course, as in any profession, there are people that make a living training professionals, and small companies that do so on a somewhat larger scale. But as in the whole psychotherapy business, that is decidedly at the cottage industry level. <a href="/wiki/User:Djlewis" title="User:Djlewis">djlewis</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Djlewis" title="User talk:Djlewis">talk</a>) 02:23, 11 June 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b> The following link is not a bad review of some of the research issues with EMDR. In short, EMDR just piggybacks on proven methodologies such as exposure therapy, and the "trademarked" eye movement part is the added snakeoil for sale. Your claim that what is unique about EMDR is "proven, highly effective and beneficial" is laughably ambitious, to say the least, as is the claim that the intellectual property and related restrictions have not interfered with full objective scientific study and review. Let's see the collection of studies showing that EMDR is significantly more effective than the same therapy without the eye movement. But what has been successfully demonstrated with EMDR is the efficacy of a tightly controlled marketing campaign of pseudoscience over the years -- I'll certainly concede that.</p>
<p>I'll also concede that Wikipedia articles are reference driven, and so the constricted nature of the research on EMDR would seem challenging to note in the main article as that is commentary. (And I am certainly not questioning that there should be a Wikipedia article on EMDR, given its prevalency.) As to the claim that effectiveness is irrelevant...really?</p>

<p>That quackwatch article is suspect on several grounds. First, why does it lead with the original, long but outdated (now 18 years old) piece rather than the much more recent update.</p>
<p>Second, the author uses some questionable rhetorical devices, such as this passage...</p>
<ul>
<li>The controlled research is consistent in showing that EMDR is superior to no treatment and most likely, supportive counseling, for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Nevertheless, this research also consistently demonstrates that EMDR is no more effective than standard behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies that rely on exposing individuals to anxiety-provoking stimuli</li>
</ul>
<p>...rather than...</p>
<ul>
<li>The controlled research is consistent in showing that EMDR and cognitive-behavioral therapies with prolonged exposure to traumatic material are equally effective for treating PTSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>...which is true, more direct and leaves a more accurate impression. I know it's not polite to say this, but the author seems to be straining to create a negative impression from facts that do not support it, in fact, say the opposite.</p>
<p>Third, the author makes several highly biased statements or recommendations against EMDR therapists who make excessive claims that could be equally said of prolonged exposure treatment or any therapy...</p>
<ol>
<li>Mental health consumers should be suspicious of psychotherapists who use EMDR instead of (rather than in addition to) standard behavioral and cognitive-behavioral interventions</li>
<li>especially those who claim that EMDR is far more effective and efficient than other interventions.</li>
<li>Such therapists may be prone to administering nonscientific interventions of other kinds, and for going beyond the available scientific literature in other domains.</li>
<li>Hence, consumers should be wary of practitioners who advance strong assertions about EMDR's effectiveness that are not scientifically supported</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, points 1 and 3 are scientific assertions without support! Given the apparent bias of the author and his attempt to twist words, I think consumers should be suspicious of <i>his pronouncements</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effectiveness_is_irrelevant">Effectiveness is irrelevant</span></h2>
<p>The effectiveness, scientific validity or criticisms of EMDR are irrelevant to whether or not Wikipedia has an article on it. People come here looking for information, i.e. facts and Wikipedia has consistently presented those facts regardless of a particular point of view. If the EMDR article was presented with a biased POV, then we can fix that. I'm disappointed because I came to Wikipedia looking for facts, i.e. the theory behind EMDR and what I found was a discussion of whether it is pseudoscience. <a href="/wiki/Accupuncture" title="Accupuncture" class="mw-redirect">Accupuncture</a> has the same problem: it is entirely presented from a point of view of "effectiveness" and "validity."

Similarly EMDR, regardless of whether it is profit-driven pseudoscientific hogwash, still is a widely-practiced psychotherapeutic technique with its own research and theory.</p>
<p>If Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory had better research support than EMDR, that still wouldn't mean it merits an article where the latter does not. I'm pretty sure EMDR actually has more data behind it, but that doesn't matter to Wikipedia, or to people using Wikipedia.<a href="/wiki/User:Trashbird1240" title="User:Trashbird1240">Trashbird1240</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Trashbird1240" title="User talk:Trashbird1240">talk</a>) 14:21, 27 June 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This isn't an area I know much about, but clearly there are ample sources for an article about it, independently of the article about Francine Shapiro. I'm leaning towards agreeing with <a href="/wiki/User:Chris55" title="User:Chris55">User:Chris55</a>'s proposal above. Not to say the article is perfect by any means, but it seems a lot of thought has gone into improving it. Some routes for improvement:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>Anywhere</i> where EMDR is described as "effective for" something needs a citation for a suitable secondary source, including the lede (and definitely under "Depression"), to be on the safe side since this is a medical topic.</li>
<li>"She then conducted a scientific study in 1989. The success rate of that first study using trauma victims was posted in the Journal of Traumatic Stress. " This is backwards. Describe the nature of the study, the sense in which the theory was tested and put publication details in the footnote.</li>
<li>"Research on the application of EMDR therapy continues," Isn't this true of every therapy that's in use? Why even have this clause?</li>
<li>No justification for having separate sections for "Controversy over mechanisms and effectiveness" and "Empirical evidence and comparison". The evidence and arguments for the theory and practice of EMDR should be in one section, or at least one section for theoretical assumptions and another for effectiveness. Not one section for evidence and another for criticisms. See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CRITS" title="Wikipedia:CRITS" class="mw-redirect">WP:CRITS</a></li>
<li>"EMDR is often cited as a component in the treatment of complex post-traumatic stress disorder" - "often" sounds a bit vague. Is it justified by the two references?</li>
<li>"Salkovskis (2002) reported..." on what basis? Reported empirical evidence? Or a theoretical argument?</li>
<li>"some authors continue to argue that the main effective component in EMDR is exposure." - meaningful to a professional audience but not a lay audience. Must be possible to simplify the language.</li>
<li>"A 2009 review of EMDR suggests further research with different populations is needed." Isn't that a scientific cliché? Are there interventions of which this isn't true? So why mention it? Did the review have any more specific conclusions?</li>
<li>I think the concern about the book is that it's a book of case studies, which might be regarded as anecdotal. We need to avoid giving the impression that "EMDR works with depression" is proved by a single case study.</li>

<dd>My take on this is that the article is trying to look neutral without actually being neutral -- it has the feel of being written by a proponent of the technique. It looks to me from an overview of the sources that there is no consensus that the hand-movement stuff contributes anything of value -- if anything, there is a near-consensus that all the value in the technique comes from the exposure component. <a href="/wiki/User:Looie496" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Looie496" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 14:40, 29 June 2013 (UTC)

<dd>There's no MEDRS source for the depression claim. Discussions of case studies are inappropriate, and it violates NPOV and OR to generalize from case studies or suggest such generalizations are valid. It demonstrates the confirmation bias we have with most FRINGE topics - proponents select the outcomes they want, then generalize from them. --<a href="/wiki/User:Ronz" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ronz" title="User talk:Ronz">talk</a>) 16:12, 29 June 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the input. I don't see that anyone wants to retain the multiple issues on the overall article so I'll remove them, although the depression section needed better support. But since Ronz has already removed that section, it's irrelevant unless reinstated. MartinPoulter has made some useful suggestions that we could all use for improvements and there are some recent useful references in other articles (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Power_therapies" title="Power therapies">Power therapies</a>) that could be used. <a href="/wiki/User:Chris55" title="User:Chris55">Chris55</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Chris55" title="User talk:Chris55">talk</a>) 16:02, 2 July 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it odd that you bring up FRINGE concerns for a treatment that is accepted in the national guidelines of at least four countries: USA, UK, Australia and Netherlands, as well as the VA. Clearly there have been legitimate questions about the efficacy of eye movements, though more recent studies appear to be overturning the earlier doubts, and some understanding of the mechanisms is now emerging. But it seems to me that many of the problems with sources arise from the opposition of some editors to inclusion of properly published books by Francine Shapiro, which I don't understand. Normally books are not disallowed as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PRIMARY" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect">primary material</a> by WP: "primary sources that have been reliably published may be used in Wikipedia; but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them." As a consequence, various journal articles by the same author have been substituted which I would argue is worse, as they are less accessible to most people. And whereas there may be a problem in using these sources to justify the treatment, there's no reason they should not be used to explain it. Looking at the article over the last couple of years, around 17 references have been removed, a number of which are mainstream books. (If you want I can publish my own analysis.) Several legitimate researchers have been falsely accused of sock puppetry. It seems that some editors have a knee-jerk reaction to something they don't understand. <a href="/wiki/User:Chris55" title="User:Chris55">Chris55</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Chris55" title="User talk:Chris55">talk</a>) 08:50, 3 July 2013 (UTC)

<dd>The FRINGE aspect are the eye movements. The creation and promotion of EMDR also have aspects where an eye to FRINGE might help.

<dd>Ronz, you don't seem to be listening. But let that be.</dd>
<dd>I am of course aware of the controversy over the eye movement component and have felt sceptical about it myself. However, there is a more recent <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/13100/1/A_meta-analysis_of_the_contribution_of_eye_movements_in_processing_emotional_memories.pdf">meta-analysis by Lee &amp; Cujpers</a> which does show positive benefits from the eye movements and suggests that earlier analyses were flawed. As importantly, there are many studies showing that eye movements reduce vividness of unpleasant memories, which has an obvious application in coming to terms with traumatic memories, and there are reports by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://psyc.ucalgary.ca/mclab/sites/psyc.ucalgary.ca.mclab/files/gunterbodner2008brat.pdf">Gunter and Bodner</a> and others suggesting a mechanism - roughly that by occupying working memory, many of the interfering emotions are crowded out. In practice, this significantly reduces the time for change, a factor that seems to be ignored by many of the critics, including McNally.</dd>
<dd>I'm not a psychologist, though I've taken graduate courses, and am hesitant to reinstate the Mechanism section, particularly because of the intolerant treatment of those much better qualified. But I suspect that you aren't either and I would like to see a more supportive atmosphere towards newcomers to WP that isn't consistently belligerent. Can we not help them towards producing the type of NPOV article that WP strives for? <a href="/wiki/User:Chris55" title="User:Chris55">Chris55</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Chris55" title="User talk:Chris55">talk</a>) 13:43, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

<dd>"I would like to see a more supportive atmosphere towards newcomers to WP that isn't consistently belligerent" What?</dd>
<dd>If the medical consensus is now that the eye movements actually do something, then the article should reflect that.

<p>Hello, I have a question: Do you really call sick people "clients" instead of "patients"? It seems very strange to me; is this nomenclature specific to north america or universal? Of course I ask because I think the article could benefit from being written in the most universally understood way. <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/200.104.169.213" title="Special:Contributions/200.104.169.213">200.104.169.213</a> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=User_talk:200.104.169.213&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:200.104.169.213 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:44, 21 October 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether one is a "client" or a "patient" does not depend on being "sick" or "well", does it? In any case, being "patient" implies to some readers a calm demeanor which is not always accurate. Conversely, a pediatrician or a veterinarian's clients are not her patients. I would generally contend that the client makes the business decisions and selects the practitioner, while the patient receives the care which the practitioner provides. <a href="/wiki/User:LeadSongDog" title="User:LeadSongDog">LeadSongDog</a> <small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:LeadSongDog#top" title="User talk:LeadSongDog"><font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font></a></small> 21:28, 21 October 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is under the scope of WikiProject psychology and should also be under the scope of wikiproject medicine as psychiatrists use this technique. It's not reliable to use skeptic.com because no one writing a psychology paper for a decent journal would ever use such a website as a reference. This article should be written much like a psychology paper regarding quality of references (however it should be in more accessible language) and use more secondary/tertiary references. Also skeptic.com is very likely not peer reviewed by psychologists. Further the Psychology Review article is just much more in depth and a better explanation of the issues. The skeptic.com article is however written by respected psychologists (both articles have two of the same authors) but nonetheless given a choice it's still better to use a peer reviewed journal. Also <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDRS" title="Wikipedia:MEDRS" class="mw-redirect">WP:MEDRS</a> does apply to this edit because it is making a medical claim about controlled trials that question the effectiveness of EMDR, while describing Shapiro's alleged response to these null results. <a href="/wiki/User:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd" title="User:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd">Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd" title="User talk:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd">talk</a>) 23:05, 1 November 2014 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rewrite_of_controversy_section">Rewrite of controversy section</span></h2>
<p>I'm attempting to rewrite the controversy section from a chronological perspective so that it doesn't misrepresent/ignore past criticisms.</p>
<p>This <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing&amp;oldid=617472539#Controversy_over_mechanisms_and_effectiveness">July 2014 version</a> included a new and recent criticism, and the section partially reorganized soon after.</p>
<p>Recently, the section was largely rewritten to repeatedly compare old criticisms with the very latest research. I think a chronological approach could solve the concerns of those edits while not censoring notable viewpoints that may or may not be now out of date. It would probably be best to get help at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:FTN" title="Wikipedia:FTN" class="mw-redirect">WP:FTN</a> to see how to address the once fringe theories that are becoming more and more mainstream.</p>

<dd>Is the point is to cover the <i>history</i> of the controversy, or the <i>state</i> of the controversy? In the former case, a chronological sequence would make sense. In the latter, a rewrite to remove the antiquated sources (and the statements sourced to them) per <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDDATE" title="Wikipedia:MEDDATE" class="mw-redirect">wp:MEDDATE</a> would be more useful. A middle road would be to have subsections for Controversy/History and Controversy/Current.</dd>
<dd>The present melange is chaotic, and clearly has a lot of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SYN" title="Wikipedia:SYN" class="mw-redirect">wp:SYN</a> problems, but there has to be an end goal in sight, not just slash and burn. Once there's agreement on where we are headed, I would suggest that any reorganization edits be purely reorganization, without addition or deletion. Then we can let the page stabilize for a few days prior to tagging obsolete sources for replacement. Substituting the replacement sources for the dated ones should be one edit per source to minimize confusion. <a href="/wiki/User:LeadSongDog" title="User:LeadSongDog">LeadSongDog</a> <small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:LeadSongDog#top" title="User talk:LeadSongDog"><font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font></a></small> 20:52, 26 November 2014 (UTC)

<dd>The conflict here is about the sources. I've got no problems with either a chronological or state approach.

These are not peer reviewed. In the previous section on this talk page even when provided with a source from a peer reviewed journal that include exactly the same argument, Ronz still insists on using skeptic.com. I won't revert if the sources are adequate and are representative of the controversy as discussed in psychology journals.

<p>The opening sentences, "EMDR has generated a great deal of controversy since its inception in 1989. Shapiro was criticised for repeatedly increasing the length and expense of training and certification, allegedly in response to the results of controlled trials that cast doubt on EMDR's efficacy" are a true part of the historical record, yet they lack balance and add a sense of bias if they stand without comment. Thus, I have added, "<i>However, the two articles and statements such as these were rebutted in a review entitled “A critical evaluation of current views regarding eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): Clarifying points of confusion.” In the section “Historical Misinformation, Slurs and Charges of Pseudoscience,” the authors refuted the claims point by point and decried that "scientific debate has begun to degenerate into slurs, innuendo, and ad hominem attacks</i>”.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 14:29, 7 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>Actually I think the initial sentences violate POV as they are not refuted before my more recent addition--made to add balance. Also, the initial sentences come across as a slur against shapiro. Perkins and Rouanzoin very painstakingly demonstrate how the criticisms about charges for training (based on alleged ineffectiveness) were made on the basis of misrepresentations of then current research. In any event, it should be clear that the issue under discussion is of historic value only since the therapy has been well validated for PTSD during ensuing years as indicated in multiple meta-analyses and also as indicated by the therapy's acceptance by several official bodies, perhaps most notably the WHO.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 17:58, 7 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, thank you Ronz. Regarding the McNally 2013 article: on page 9, the author writes, "Yet recent basic laboratory research (Gunter &amp; Bodner, 2008), including with PTSD patients (van den Hout et al., 2012), indicates that secondary tasks, such as eye movements, that tax working memory during recollection of stressful memories attenuate their vividness and emotionality during subsequent recollection (van den Hout &amp; Engelhard, 2012). Secondary tasks that do not tax working memory (e.g., passive listening to bilateral beeps) do not have this effect. In fact, the authors of a recent meta-analysis concluded, “the eye movements do have an additional value in EMDR treatments” (Lee &amp; Cuijpers, 2013, p. 239)."<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 01:13, 1 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

So that's verified and you can remove the tag if you agree. It is good practice when using a source that mentions other sources as McNally has with van den Hout &amp; Engelhard, to read the original source, rather than take it for granted that McNally has accurately summarised the findings of that research. That may be the reason it was tagged. It is also good practice not to use extended direct quotations, better to paraphrase in your own words. <a href="/wiki/User:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd" title="User:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd">Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd" title="User talk:Woodywoodpeckerthe3rd">talk</a>) 22:44, 1 December 2014 (UTC)

<p>Here is a quite from the vanden Hout &amp; Engelhard paper- p.724-that verifies use of the citation as it is embodied in the McNally (2013) article.Van den hout: " Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective treatment for alleviating trauma symptoms, and the positive effects of this treatment have been scientifically confirmed under well-controlled conditions. This has provided an opportunity to explore how EMDR works. The present paper reports on the findings of a long series of experiments that disproved the hypothesis that eye movements or other dual tasks¹ are unnecessary." <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 20:49, 3 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ronz, Problem: How to edit the "working mechanisms" piece such that the reader can wee the state of research &amp; findings, including the narrowing focus on the two referenced mechanisms, "working memory" and "orienting reflex"/REM sleep. The current text relies on primary sources, and this is clearly problematic with respect to Wikipedia policy. Might some words of caution to the reader regarding primary sources be useful, e.g., "The working mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of EMDR therapy are still under investigation. There is as yet no definitive finding and no consensus on the effective mechanisms of this therapy. Those that have received the most attention and interest based on initial research include (1) taxing working memory[57][58][59] and (2) orienting response/REM sleep[60][61][62]" &#160;?? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 16:52, 7 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Re: "The working mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of EMDR therapy are still under investigation.

I think something close to this should be in the article, with more context and perhaps more weight. The rest seems too far into SYN/MEDRS/DUE/FUTURE problems.

<p>Thank you Ronz. I've been distracted by other things, myself. I expect to be able to enter some more discussion of this topic and propose a chage later in this 24 hour period.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 11:36, 11 December 2014 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about "<i>The working mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of the eye movements in EMDR therapy are still under investigation and there is as yet no definitive finding. The consensus regarding the underlying biological mechanisms involve the two that have received the most attention and research support: (1) taxing working memory and (2) orienting response/REM sleep. [Lee &amp; Cuijpers, 2013]"</i></p>
<p>Reason for putting it this way: Lee &amp; Cuijpers 2013 conducted a meta-analysis of studies pitting eye movements against no eye movements in both clinical and non-clinical laboratory situations. After reporting results of their meta-analysis demonstrating the significant contribution of eye movements, they review studies examining the underlying mechanisms that make the eye movements effective. They report, "One account for the effect of eye movements is provided by working memory theories of EMDR (Andrade et al., 1997; Gunter &amp; Bodnher, 2008; Maxfield et al., 2008; van den Hout et al., 2011)..... Another model to account for the possible role of eye movements that has some empirical support is that the eye movements elicit an orienting response (Barrowcliff, Gray, MacCulloch, Freeman, &amp; MacCulloch, 2003; Sack, Lempa, Steinmetz, Lamprecht, &amp; Hofmann, 2008; Schubert, Lee, &amp; Drummond, 2011). According to orienting response theory the eye movements activate an "investigatory reflex" in which first, an alert response occurs, then, a reflexive pause produces dearousal in the face of no threat. This reflex results in a state of heightened alertness and permits exploratory behavior...." <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 20:02, 11 December 2014 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above quote of Lee &amp; Cuijpers came from p. 237 of their 2013 meta-analysis.<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Saturn_Explorer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Saturn Explorer (page does not exist)">Saturn Explorer</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Saturn_Explorer" title="User talk:Saturn Explorer">talk</a>) 13:25, 12 December 2014 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The relevant para in that source is the very last one, which says "EMDR is also in the early stages of being identified as a type of treatment for attachment disorders, grief, nightmares, other anxiety disorders, and substance disorders. Research to date is limited, but the results available indicate that comorbid disorders may also respond to EMDR. It is important to explore the potential of EMDR to provide clinicians with a treatment model that can traverse many symptom presentations in an efficient manner." -- <a href="/wiki/PubMed_Central" title="PubMed Central">PMC</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189702/">4189702</a> There's a significant delta from "in the early stages of being identified" to "is currently being researched as a possible treatment".

<dd>No. Given that this is an encyclopedia and this is a MEDRS topic, I doubt any such sources exist that would meet our policies. (I hope I can assume that everyone here knows it is expected that any research paper will include at least a brief mention of possible areas of future research.) Hypothetically, someone might review the research on a topic looking specifically for promising areas of future research, then summarizing their findings. (I'd expect that such papers are written as part of the process of calling for research, but if I've ever seen such a thing I've forgotten about it.) However, we're not going to confuse a simple statement of possible future directions as a statement about what areas are actually promising as a whole. Granted, statements coming from a review are better than from primary research. Still, if editors can find GA MEDRS articles that include such information, it would be worth discussing them and examining what types of references they use. --<a href="/wiki/User:Ronz" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ronz" title="User talk:Ronz">talk</a>) 18:50, 14 December 2014 (UTC)

<dd>I respectfully disagree to the extent that you are assuming that there is a need to go beyond the source. There isn't; the proposed wording above may be overbroad, but a narrower version would be fine, I think.. If a source that otherwise passes MEDRS for other purposes in this article states the direction for future research, then it is also a RS for a statement here as to the recommended direction of future research.
