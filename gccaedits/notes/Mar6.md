#Clean pull
- First thoughts:
 - Having a clean version updated to March 6th by Nick Ruest (Ruebot) is a godsend.
 - The version I have is a stripped down .csv than what I can gather from http://github.com/ruebot but it is sufficient for me.
 - CBC: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; DND: Department of National Defence; HoC: House of Commons; MoC: Museum of Civilization; CSA: Canadian Space Agency; CSC: Correctional Services Canada; DoFO: Department of Fisheries and Oceans; DoJ: Department of Justice; EC: Environment Canada; FCC: Federal Court of Canada; FC: Finance Canada; GoC: Government of Canada; IC Industry Canada; LAC: Library and Archives Canada; NRC: Natural Resources Canada; SSC: Shared Services Canada; SC: Statistics Canada; TC: Transport Canada
 - CBC: 40 edits; DND: 463; HoC: 159; MoC: 5; CSA: 10; CSC: 1; DoFO: 22; DoJ: 29; EC: 378; FCC: 1; FC: 24; GoC: 54; IC: 44; LAC: 31; NRC: 73; SSC: 745; SC: 19; TC: 11
- Initial Conclusions:
 - the big editors: DND with 463, SSC with 745, and EC with 378
 - the small editors: CSC with 1, FCC with 1, and MOC with 5
 - Importance scale from 0 (being vandalism/reverted edits) to 3 (being a full rewrite of article)
- Thoughts from the small edits:
 - CSC: an edit to "Bansi Lal" (and Indian independence activist) with a deletion to 'Political Legacy' which was instantly reverted, Importance = 0.
 - FCC: an edit to "Maritime University Field Lacrosse League" with the addition of a Head Coach, Importance = 1.
 - MOC: two edits to "Report on the Affairs of British North America" with the correction of a broken link, Importance = 1.
 - MOC: an edit to "Feminist art movement" with a spelling correction, Importance = 1.
 - MOC: an edit to "Bobby Shmurda" (French Wikipedia) with the changing of a birth name, instantly reverted, Importance = 0.
 - MOC: an edit to "Tabagie (feast)" with a spelling correction, Importance = 1.
- Thoughts from the big edits:
 - SSC: edits to "2014 ATP World Tour Finals – Singles," Importance = 1.
 - SSC: edits to "Bennett, British Columbia" with general article improvements, Importance = 1.
 - SSC: edits to "Cameroon national football team" with general article improvements, Importance = 2.

 - SSC: edits to "Star Citizen" lots of attempted updates, many reverts, Importance = 1.
 - SSC as a whole is doing unimportant editing, much of which is link correcting or being reverted.
 - DND: edits to "Charny (Lévis)" lots of what appears to be vandalism and being reverted, Importance = 0.
 - DND: edits to "Colt Canada C7 rifle" with a lot of updating and an unconfirmed improvement to the rifle for Canada, Importance = 3.

 - DND: edits to "HMCS Annapolis (DDH 265)," "HMCS Calgary," "HMCS Carleton," "HMCS Charlottetown (FFH 339)," "HMCS Esquimalt (J272)," "HMCS Fredericton (FFH 337)," "HMCS Iroquois (DDG 280)," "HMCS Montcalm," "HMCS Preserver (AOR 510)," "HMCS Prevost," "HMCS Protecteur (AOR 509)," and "HMCS St. John's (FFH 340)" all edited a few times, minor edits, Importance = 1.
 - DND: edits to "South Alberta Light Horse" minor edits and improvements, Importance = 1.
 - DND as a whole is interested in a very wide array of articles, but only editing them once/twice, different than SSC in that regard; a lot of editing in French as well.
 - EC: edits to "File:Klatka meteorologiczna 01.JPG" through "File:Klatka meteorologiczna 07.JPG" category improvements, Importance = 1.
 - EC: edits to user accounts, sandbox style additional pages being edited, all French users, Importance = 1.
 - EC as a whole cares most about editing images (called Files) and correcting categories and how clouds are classified, and about editing in French.
