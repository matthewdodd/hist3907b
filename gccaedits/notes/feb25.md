- I have performed two grabs using twarc and in the .json file I have tweets from more that just GCCAedits
 - I want to remove these as I'm not particularly interested in other tweets
 - The fast way to do this is to bookmark all of the lines that contain the phrase: '"source": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gccaedits\"'
 - After I've makred the lines I can then select: Search>Bookmark>Remove_unmarked_lines
