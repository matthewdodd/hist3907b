- I have performed two grabs using twarc and in the .json file I have tweets from more that just GCCAedits
 - I want to remove these as I'm not particularly interested in other tweets
 - The fast way to do this is to bookmark all of the lines that contain the phrase: '"source": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gccaedits\"'
 - After I've makred the lines I can then select: Search>Bookmark>Remove_unmarked_lines
- The next clean up steps are that I really only want the contents of the tweets:
 - First remove the text prior to the start of the tweets text, just a find replace with blank
 - Next step is to (select the radio for Extended) Find: ' "in_reply_to_status_id": null,' and Replace: \r
 - Now book mark all lines with: ' "id": ' and then Search>Bookmark>Remove_Bookmarked_lines
 - And the final cleaning step is to Find: '"," and Replace: ''
- A recomendation for myself: get the full URL before beginning the cleaning process
