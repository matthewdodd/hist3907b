# Matthew Dodd

![alt text][logo] My goals, reasons, and justifications for why I want to take [HIST 3907B] - Data Mining and Visualization.

- Why you are taking this class?
 - I want to compliment my experiences in [HIST 3812] and [HIST 4805] by expanding my skills and capabilities with another method of looking at, working with, and displaying historical research.
- What you hope to achieve here?
 - I'd like to be able to augment my [online portfolio] with a more data driven project. I'd also like to explore a great many more pieces of software and their capabilities for enhancing written works.
- The kind of digital experience you already have versus the kind of experience you wish to have.
 - Having worked on/working on projects in HIST 3812 and HIST 4805 I have some idea of the digital aspects on writing on history. Outside of digital history I have work experience as a PC Deployment Technician with the [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] and as a server/systems administrative technician with a [consultancy] focused on information management.
