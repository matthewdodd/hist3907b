#Checkpoint 2
- Principle method for exploring data 
 - I initially grabbed data using TWARC with the search as 'gccaedits' in an attempt to gather as much data as possible. It appears that Nick Ruest of York University has put up all of the tweets on his github account, so I've downloaded these to facilitate a larger data chunk to analyze.
 - I intend to do some sort of network visualization to see what departments/agencies are editing by topic (general topics: sports, politics, television, etc.).
 - The second thing I will attempt to do is some form of mapping to actually place where these edits are coming from: the research question on this is whether the edits are from headquarters or smaller branches.
- I believe that the mapping aspect will be the larger of the two aspects listed above, though my working title (Editing the Internet: What the Government wants you to know) focuses on what the edits themselves are.
