 - Setting up a domain is usually a simple task.
 - In my case it was even easier because I already owned one domain

 - A README.md is essential for file structure and order.
 - Resoph notes was a pain to use, and although I managed to use it for taking notes on Big Data, it had no way to automatically increment the page titles and I ended up with overlap
