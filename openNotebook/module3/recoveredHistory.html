					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">his</a> feelings, that <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> could not have remained, even though 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">his</a> health had been quite unaffected, which, however, was not the case; and after a few weeks' residence on the estate, 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> resolved to return to <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=England&amp;params=51_30_N_0_7_W_type:country" title="England">England</a>, 
					in which <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> met with no opposition. <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">His</a> statement is as follows:</p>
<p>	"The slaves on the estate were constantly attended by <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)Driver">drivers</a> with cart or cattle whips, which they were in the habit of using as here carmen use 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">their</a> whips on horses; and occasionally one or more slaves were ordered out of the line of work, laid prostrate on the ground, and received a few lashes 
					(from two or three to ten) on their posteriors, for no other offence that <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> could perceive or ever heard of but that of being indolent, or lagging at their work, 
					or being late. <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">He</a> saw a few working with iron-collars round their necks, connected with each other by a chain; a punishment which, 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> understood, was usually inflicted for running away, and continued sometimes for several weeks. The huts of the slaves were very indifferent, and almost destitute of 
					furniture. On Sunday they either attended market, or worked in their own grounds; but none went, or were expected to go to any church or place of worship; nor did <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> 
					ever see or hear of any instruction, religious or otherwise, being bestowed upon them. Many of the slaves had women living with them as their wives; but as for marriage being used, either as a means of civilization or for any other purpose, 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> never even heard the word mentioned as, it respected them. <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">He</a> understood that the White servants 
					were not allowed to take those women who so lived with particular men; but as for any others, they not only chose and took such as pleased them, but they were expected to do it as a matter of course. Accordingly, 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> was invited by the <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)Overseer">overseer</a> to follow the general practice, the very first day 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> arrived on the estate. In a spare house, kept for the occasional use of persons coming thither for a few days, were women whom 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> understood to be at the service of whoever came to occupy the apartments, and two of them were spoken of as the children of a former proprietor.</p>
<p> "But little provisions appeared to him to be given to the slaves. Herrings and such fish, rather as sauce than as food, were given them. But they had grounds allotted them, and the Sunday, throughout the year, for their cultivation, 
					with every or every other Saturday out of crop-time (the practice on this head differing); and while strong and in good health, this <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> thought might do very well. 
					But in crop-time (on some estates nearly half the year) they could have very little leisure or inclination to work for themselves, being often greatly fatigued by extra night-work and watching. 
					<a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">He</a> understood that, by the law of <a style="color:#00CC00;text-decoration:none;" href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Jamaica&amp;params=17_59_N_76_48_W_type:country" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, 
					only thirty-nine lashes could be given at once, but <a style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;" href="?" title="?, ?(?-?)?">he</a> was told, on the spot, that an overseer could easily, when so disposed, evade it."</p>
