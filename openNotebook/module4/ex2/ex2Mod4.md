- It's very easy to use the TopicModelingTool
- The tool is very quick for sorting into 'buckets' of words
 - I wonder how fast the tool would be on information with an incredibly large dataset?
- I find it interesting how words can be put into different buckets
 - For my all_topics.html file both buckets 3 and 4 have "mr" as the first word sorted into it
 - Doesn't this detract from the topics being modelled?
- Once you have a flat set of data this is probably the simplest way to model it
