- Using RStudio is something I am familiar with
 - This constant need to install packages is a little annoying
 - If only there was a way, via CRAN, to install all of the packages at once

 - the scripts themselves are a little convoluted and require programming knowledge to understand
- The next step, the stopWordsList.txt does not exists on my local machine and so I cannot go further in depth with out it, but it seems straight forward enough
- This is another very useful way to visualize data and is significantly more powerful than the topicModelingTool.jar
