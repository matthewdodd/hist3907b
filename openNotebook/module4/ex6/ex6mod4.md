- The visualization (Cirrus) is a fantastic way to see what words are being used
- The difference between multi article uploads and single article uploads is enormous
 - I did the same for another project (HIST4915D) and that can be found [here.](https://github.com/matthewdodd/hist4915d/blob/master/voyant-tools_corpus.txt)
- Voyant tools offers a wide variety of information, including word use over time, which is only useful in multi article uploads, or large documents
 - The way that Voyant Tools allows for an instance to be running on your system rather than off of a server based in (wherever) is great for protection of data and ethics concerns
