- Inkscape and vector graphics
 - The ease with which good pdf files can be imported and exploded is phenomenal
- Once exploded the rotation of numbers/images/text and other modifications is simple
- it's a great way to take a simple image or pdf and make it more visually appealing
 - The best part for me is the ability to modify any aspect of the image/pdf rather than have to modify in the original format
