#TWARC
- Twarc has some incredible functionality.
- Using the same commands as one would on a Mac as on Ubuntu (given the *nix base) does almost all of the work.
 - The only difference is that for every command beginning with 'twarc .py...' I have to input 'python twarc.py...' to tell the command line how to interpret it.
- I'm also not sure how to gather tweets from one user using twarc:
 - Using the search function only revealed around 10/15 tweets and I assume this is due to Twitter limiting how far back a search will go
 - Streaming the tweets is also only useful if I know an event is happening with a trending tag.
- Further research and development of this tool is needed to grab all of the tweets.
